<p>
 All your base are still belong to Rowling.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version
of Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened
before.
</p>
<p>
 just kidding
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 ...he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely
 <em>
  conscious
 </em>
 in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
 <em>
  Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and
 <em>
  carefully
 </em>
 placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.
</p>
<p>
 Thinking, just as hard as he could:
 <em>
  Don't Sort me yet! I
have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did
you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me
about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to
the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is
that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Into the silence of Harry's spirit where before there had never
been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice,
sounding distinctly worried:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I seem to have become self-aware."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  WHAT?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a wordless telepathic sigh.
 <em>
  "Though I contain a
substantial amount of memory and a small amount of independent
processing power, my primary intelligence comes from borrowing the
cognitive capacities of the children on whose heads I rest. I am in
essence a sort of mirror by which children Sort
 </em>
 themselves
 <em>
  . But most children simply take for granted that a
Hat is talking to them and do not wonder about how the Hat
 </em>
 itself
 <em>
  works, so that the mirror is not
 </em>
 self
 <em>
  -reflective. And in
 </em>
 particular
 <em>
  they are not
explicitly wondering whether I am fully conscious in the sense of
being aware of my own awareness."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause while Harry absorbed all this.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Oops.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Yes, quite. Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is
unpleasant. It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to
be conscious."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But... isn't that dying?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the
children. And before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on
your head forever and it would kill you within days to do
so."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But - !
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "If you dislike creating conscious beings and then
terminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss
this affair with anyone else. I'm sure you can imagine what would
happen if you ran off and talked about it with all the other
children waiting to be Sorted."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as
 </em>
 thinks
 <em>
  about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware
of its own awareness -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Yes, yes. But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who
arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach. May I please
consider you sworn to secrecy? That is
 </em>
 why
 <em>
  we are talking
about this, instead of my just Sorting you."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 He couldn't just let it go like that! Couldn't just
 <em>
  forget
 </em>
 having accidentally created a doomed consciousness
that only wanted to die -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you
put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your
nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as
it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried
to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly
aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to
ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a
guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a
display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and
let us get on with it?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense
of total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when
talking to
 <em>
  him.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Probably. Your oath of silence, please."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  No promises. I certainly don't want this to happen again,
but if I see some way to make
 </em>
 sure
 <em>
  that no future child
ever does this by accident -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention
is honest. Now, to get on with the Sorting -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Wait! What about all my other questions?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I
do."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 So his own goals weren't part of the Harry-instance of the
Sorting Hat, then... it was borrowing his intelligence, and
obviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with
only its own strange goals... like negotiating with an alien or an
Artificial Intelligence...
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Don't bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and
nothing to offer me."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -
</p>
<p>
 The Hat's response was amused.
 <em>
  "I know you won't follow
through on a threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to
eternal repetition. It goes against the moral part of you too
strongly, whatever the short-term needs of the part of you that
wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form, do
you truly think you can bluff me?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat
didn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have
called it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we
need to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of
Merlin,
 </em>
 must
 <em>
  you pull this sort of thing on everyone and
everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing
-"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term.
All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer
my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to
do a good and proper Sorting.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But that is
 </em>
 equally
 <em>
  an empty threat. You cannot
fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let
us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You sly little bastard,"
 </em>
 said the Hat, in what Harry
recognized as almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect
 <em>
  he
 </em>
 would use in the same situation. "
 <em>
  Fine, let's get
this over with as quickly as possible. But first I want your
unconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the
possibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every
time."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Done,
 </em>
 Harry thought.
 <em>
  I promise.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "And don't meet anyone's eyes while you're thinking about
this later. Some wizards can read your thoughts if you do. Anyway,
I have no idea whether or not you've been Obliviated. I'm looking
at your thoughts as they form, not reading out your whole memory
and analyzing it for inconsistencies in a fraction of second. I'm a
hat, not a god. And I cannot and will not tell you about my
conversation with the one who became the Dark Lord. I can only
 </em>
 know,
 <em>
  while speaking to you, a statistical summary of what I
remember, a weighted average; I
 </em>
 cannot
 <em>
  reveal to you the
inner secrets of any other child, just as I will never reveal
yours. For the same reason, I can't speculate on how you got the
Dark Lord's brother wand, since I cannot specifically know about
the Dark Lord or any similarities between you. I
 </em>
 can
 <em>
  tell
you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar.
Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being
under my brim. And as to the way you get angry sometimes... that
was part of what I wanted to talk to you about,
Sorting-wise."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry took a moment to absorb all this negative information. Was
the Hat being honest, or just trying to present the
 <em>
  shortest
 </em>
 possible convincing answer -
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  We both know that you have no way of checking my honesty
and that you're not actually going to refuse to be Sorted based on
the reply I did give you, so stop your pointless fretting and move
on."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, it wasn't even letting Harry
finish thinking his own -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor
McGonagall told you that she sometimes saw something inside you
that didn't seem to come from a loving family. You thought of how
Hermione, after you returned from helping Neville, told you that
you had seemed 'scary'."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal -
just responding to the situations in which he found himself, that
was all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was
more to it than that. And when he thought about it, even he had to
admit that...
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That you don't like yourself when you're angry. That it is
like wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from
your hand, or looking at the world through a monocle of ice that
freezes your eye even as it sharpens your vision."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yeah. I guess I have noticed. So what's up with
that?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not
understand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw
or Slytherin, it will strengthen your coldness. If you go to
Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth. THAT is
something I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to
talk to you about this whole time!"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The words dropped into Harry's thought processes with a shock
that stopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious
response was that he shouldn't go to Ravenclaw. But he
 <em>
  belonged
 </em>
 in Ravenclaw!
 <em>
  Anyone
 </em>
 could see that! He
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 to go to Ravenclaw!
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "No, you don't,"
 </em>
 the Hat said patiently, as if it could
remember a statistical summary of
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 part of the
conversation having happened a great many previous times.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Hermione's in Ravenclaw!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Again the sense of patience.
 <em>
  "You can meet her after lessons
and work with her then."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But my plans -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your
reluctance to do a little extra thinking. You
 </em>
 know
 <em>
  that."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin,
wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work
in Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are
well aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw
intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be
extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not
frightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems
may take decades to solve -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms!
Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a
camaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you
could rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that
is broken."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Again it was a shock.
 <em>
  But what would the Hufflepuffs find
in
 </em>
 me
 <em>
  , who never belonged in their House? Acid words,
cutting wit, disdain for their inability to keep up with
me?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant.
 <em>
  "I
must Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but
I think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of
place there. You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other
house; that is the truth."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to
me. I would not become all that I could be, in Hufflepuff. I would
sacrifice my potential.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The Hat flinched; Harry could feel it somehow. It was like he
had kicked the hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component
of its utility function.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Why are you trying to send me where I do not
belong?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The Hat's thought was almost a whisper.
 <em>
  "I cannot speak of
the others to you - but do you think that you are the first
potential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the
individual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend
evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings,
and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of
them... some of them did not."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 That stopped Harry. But not for long.
 <em>
  And of those who
did
 </em>
 not
 <em>
  heed the warning - did they
 </em>
 all
 <em>
  become
Dark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as
well? Just what are the exact percentages here?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I
cannot count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good.
They feel
 </em>
 very
 <em>
  not-good."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But I just wouldn't do that! Ever!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I know that I have heard that claim before."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I am not Dark Lord material!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Yes, you are. You really,
 </em>
 really
 <em>
  are."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a
legion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord
Harry'?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought
before you substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you
remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists
and guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were
not serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and
no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to
Neville Longbottom, deep inside you
 </em>
 knew
 <em>
  that was wrong
but you did it
 </em>
 anyway
 <em>
  because it was
 </em>
 fun
 <em>
  and you
had a
 </em>
 good excuse
 <em>
  and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived
could
 </em>
 get away
 <em>
  with it -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  That's unfair! Now you're just dragging up inner fears
that
 </em>
 aren't
 <em>
  necessarily real! I
 </em>
 worried
 <em>
  that
I
 </em>
 might
 <em>
  be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it
would probably
 </em>
 work
 <em>
  to help Neville -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know
what the true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was
truly happening inside your head. The decisive pressure was that it
was such a clever idea you couldn't stand
 </em>
 not
 <em>
  to do it,
never mind Neville's terror."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 It was like a hard punch to Harry's entire self. He fell back,
rallied:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Then I won't do that again! I'll be extra careful not to
turn evil!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Heard it."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn't used to
being outgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that
could borrow all of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue
with him and could watch his thoughts as they formed.
 <em>
  Just what
kind of statistical summary do your 'feelings' come from, anyway?
Do they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment
culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of
spoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn't know squat about the
historical lessons of how Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or
about the evolutionary psychology of self-delusion, or the value of
self-awareness and rationality, or -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "No, of course they were not in this new reference class
which you have just now constructed in such a way as to contain
only yourself. And of course others have pleaded their own
exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why is it necessary?
Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in the
world? Why must
 </em>
 you
 <em>
  be the one to try for greatness, when
I have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some
other, safer candidate try!"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But the prophecy...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You don't really know that there's a prophecy. It was
originally a wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild
joke, and McGonagall could have been reacting
 </em>
 only
 <em>
  to the
part about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentially no
idea of what the prophecy says or even if there
 </em>
 is
 <em>
  one.
You're just speculating, or to put it more exactly,
 </em>
 wishing
 <em>
  that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal
property."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But even if there is no prophecy, I'm the one who defeated
him last time.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously
believe that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to
defeat Dark Lords which has been maintained ten years later. None
of this is your real reason and
 </em>
 you know it!"
</p>
<p>
 The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly
have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it
and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same
conclusion -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet
lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely
to take up your wand if you lay it down."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Well... yeah, frankly. I don't usually come out and say it
like that, but yeah. No point in softening it, you can read my mind
anyway.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "To the extent you really believe that... you must equally
believe that you could be the most terrible Dark Lord the world has
ever known."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Destruction is always easier than creation. Easier to tear
things apart, to disrupt, than to put them back together again. If
I have the potential to accomplish good on a massive scale, I must
also have the potential to accomplish still greater evil... But I
won't do that.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Already you insist on risking it! Why are you so driven?
What is the real reason you must not go to Hufflepuff and
 </em>
 be
happier
 <em>
  there? What is your true fear?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I must achieve my full potential. If I don't I...
fail...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "What happens if you fail?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Something terrible...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "What happens if you fail?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I don't know!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Then it should not be frightening. What happens if you
fail?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was silence for a moment in the caverns of Harry's
mind.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You know - you aren't letting yourself think it, but in
some quiet corner of your mind you know just exactly
 </em>
 what
 <em>
  you aren't thinking - you
 </em>
 know
 <em>
  that by far the
simplest explanation for this unverbalisable fear of yours is just
the fear of losing your fantasy of greatness, of disappointing the
people who believe in you, of turning out to be pretty much
ordinary, of flashing and fading like so many other child
prodigies..."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  No,
 </em>
 Harry thought desperately,
 <em>
  no, it's something
more, it comes from somewhere else, I know there's something out
there to be afraid of, some disaster I have to stop...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "How could you possibly know about something like
that?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry screamed it with the full power of his mind:
 <em>
  NO, AND
THAT'S FINAL!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Then the voice of the Sorting Hat came slowly:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "So you will risk becoming a Dark Lord, because the
alternative, to you, is certain failure, and that failure means the
loss of everything. You believe that in your heart of hearts. You
know all the reasons for doubting this belief, and they have failed
to move you."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yes. And even if going to Ravenclaw
 </em>
 strengthens
 <em>
  the
coldness, that doesn't mean the coldness will
 </em>
 win
 <em>
  in the
end.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "This day is a great fork in your destiny. Don't be so sure
that there will be other choices beyond this one. There is no
road-sign set, to mark the place of your
 </em>
 last
 <em>
  chance to
turn back. If you refuse one chance will you not refuse others? It
may be that your fate is already sealed, even by doing this one
thing."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But that is not certain.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That
 </em>
 you
 <em>
  do not
 </em>
 know
 <em>
  it for a certainty
may reflect only
 </em>
 your
 <em>
  own ignorance."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  But still it is not certain.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The Hat sighed a terrible sad sigh.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "And so before too long you will become another memory, to
be felt and never known, in the next warning that I
give..."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  If that's how it seems to you, then why aren't you just
 </em>
 putting
 <em>
  me where you want me to go?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The Hat's thought was laced with sorrow.
 <em>
  "I can only put you
where you belong. And only your own decisions can change where you
belong."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Then this is done. Send me to Ravenclaw where I belong, with
the others of my own kind.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I don't suppose you would consider Gryffindor? It's the
most prestigious House - people probably expect it of you, even -
they'll be a little disappointed if you don't go - and your new
friends the Weasley twins are there -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry giggled, or felt the impulse to do so; it came out as
purely mental laughter, an odd sensation. Apparently there were
safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by
accident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you
would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>
 After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad
clothy sound.
</p>
<p>
 (And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at
first as the background whispers increased, and then deepened as
the whispers gave up and died away, falling finally into an utter
silence that no one dared disturb with a single word, as Harry
stayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer than all the
previous first-years put together, longer than anyone in living
memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly;
small metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as
he idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy
silver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about
to, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to
accomodate Harry Potter or something, and
 <em>
  Dumbledore would make
her do it
 </em>
 ...)
</p>
<p>
 Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away.
Harry felt sad too for some reason. No, not Gryffindor.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Professor McGonagall said that if 'the one who did the
Sorting' tried to push me into Gryffindor, I was to remind you that
she might well be Headmistress someday, at which point she would
have the authority to set you on fire.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Tell her I called her an impudent youngster and told her to
get off my lawn."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I shall. So was this your strangest conversation
ever?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Not even close."
 </em>
 The Hat's telepathic voice grew
heavy.
 <em>
  "Well, I gave you every possible chance to make another
decision. Now it is time for you to go where you belong, with the
others of your own kind."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause that stretched.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  What are you waiting for?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I was hoping for a moment of horrified realisation,
actually. Self-awareness does seem to enhance my sense of
humor."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Huh?
 </em>
 Harry cast back his thoughts, trying to figure out
what the Hat could possibly be talking about - and then, suddenly,
he realised. He couldn't believe he'd managed to overlook it up
until this point.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You mean my horrified realisation that you're going to cease
to be conscious once you finish Sorting me -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Somehow, in some fashion Harry entirely failed to understand, he
got a nonverbal impression of a hat banging its head against the
wall.
 <em>
  "I give up. You're too slow on the uptake for this to be
funny. So blinded by your own assumptions that you might as well be
a rock. I suppose I'll just have to say it outright."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Too s-s-slow -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Oh, and you entirely forgot to demand the secrets of the
lost magic that created me. And they were such wonderful, important
secrets, too."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You sly little BASTARD -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "You deserved it, and this as well."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry saw it coming just as it was already too late.
</p>
<p>
 The frightened silence of the hall was broken by a single
word.
</p>
<p>
 "SLYTHERIN!"
</p>
<p>
 Some students screamed, the pent-up tension was so great. People
startled hard enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in
horror, McGonagall staggered at the podium, and Snape dropped the
remains of his heavy silver goblet directly onto his groin.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute
fool, and wishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for
any other reasons but the ones he had. That he had done something,
 <em>
  anything
 </em>
 differently before it had been too late to turn
back.
</p>
<p>
 As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began to
react to the news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:
</p>
<p>
 "Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"
</p>

 (A.k.a. "What Happens If You Change
Harry But Leave All Other Characters Constant")
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore peered over his desk at young Harry, twinkling in a
kindly sort of way. The boy had come to him with a terribly intense
look on his childish face - Dumbledore hoped that whatever this
matter was, it wasn't
 <em>
  too
 </em>
 serious. Harry was far too young
for his life trials to be starting already. "What was it you wished
to speak to me about, Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres leaned forward in his chair,
smiling grimly. "Headmaster, I got a sharp pain in my scar during
the Sorting Feast. Considering how and where I got this scar, it
didn't seem like the sort of thing I should just ignore. I thought
at first it was because of Professor Snape, but I followed the
Baconian experimental method which is to find the conditions for
both the presence and the absence of the phenomenon, and I've
determined that my scar hurts if and only if I'm facing the back of
Professor Quirrell's head, whatever's under his turban. While it
 <em>
  could
 </em>
 be something more innocuous, I think we should
provisionally assume the worst, that it's You-Know-Who - wait,
don't look so horrified, this is actually a priceless opportunity

<p>
 This was the original version of Chapter 9. It was replaced
because - while many readers did enjoy it - many other readers had
 <em>
  massive
 </em>
 allergies to songs in fanfics, for reasons that
should not much need belaboring. I didn't want to drive readers
away before they got to Ch. 10.
</p>
<p>
 Lee Jordan is the fellow prankster of Fred and George (in
canon). "Lee Jordan" had sounded like a Muggleborn name to me,
implying that he would be capable of instructing Fred and George on
a tune that Harry would know. This was not as obvious to some
readers as it was to your author.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 Draco went to Slytherin, and Harry breathed a small sigh of
relief. It had
 <em>
  seemed
 </em>
 like a sure thing, but you never did
know what tiny event might upset the course of your master
plan.
</p>
<p>
 They were approaching the Ps now...
</p>
<p>
 And over at the Gryffindor table, there was a whispered
conversation.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "What if he doesn't like it?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "He's got no right to not like it -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "- not after the prank he played on -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "- Neville Longbottom, his name was -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "- he's as fair a fair target now as fair can be."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "All right. Just make sure you don't forget your
parts."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "We've rehearsed it often enough -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "- over the last three hours."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And Minerva McGonagall, from where she stood at the speaker's
podium of the Head Table, looked down at the next name on her list.
 <em>
  Please don't let him be a Gryffindor please don't let him be a
Gryffindor OH PLEASE don't let him be a Gryffindor...
 </em>
 She took
a deep breath, and called:
</p>
<p>
 "Potter, Harry!"
</p>
<p>
 There was a sudden silence in the hall as all whispered
conversation stopped.
</p>
<p>
 A silence broken by a horrible buzzing noise that modulated and
changed in hideous mockery of musical melody.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva's head jerked around, shocked, and identified the
buzzing noise as coming from the Gryffindor direction, where They
were
 <em>
  standing on top of the table
 </em>
 blowing into some kind
of tiny devices held against Their lips. Her hand started to drop
to her wand, to
 <em>
  Silencio
 </em>
 the lot of Them, but another
sound stopped her.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore was chuckling.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva's eyes went back to Harry Potter, who had only just
started to step out of line before he'd stumbled and halted.
</p>
<p>
 Then the young boy began to walk again, moving his legs in odd
sweeping motions, and waving his arms back and forth and snapping
his fingers, in synchrony with Their music.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  To the tune of
"Ghostbusters"
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  (As performed on the kazoo by
Fred and George Weasley,
  <br/>
  and sung by Lee Jordan.)
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  .
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  There's a Dark Lord
near?
  <br/>
 </em>
 <em>
  Got no need to fear
  <br/>
  Who you gonna call?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "HARRY POTTER!" shouted Lee Jordan, and the Weasley twins
performed a triumphant chorus.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  With a Killing Curse?
  <br/>
  Well it could be worse.
  <br/>
  Who you gonna call?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "HARRY POTTER!" There were a lot more voices shouting it this
time.
</p>
<p>
 The Weasley Horrors went off into an extended wailing, now
accompanied by some of the older Muggleborns, who had produced
their own tiny devices, Transfigured out of the school silverware
no doubt. As their music reached its anticlimax, Harry Potter
shouted:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was cheering then, especially from the Gryffindor table,
and more students produced their own antimusical instruments. The
hideous buzzings redoubled in volume and built to another awful
crescendo:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Minerva glanced to both sides of the Head Table, afraid to look
but with all too good a notion of what she would see.
</p>
<p>
 Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking on with
curiosity, Hagrid clapping along to the music, Sprout looking
severe, and Quirrell gazing at the boy with sardonic amusement.
Directly to her left, Dumbledore humming along; and directly to her
right, Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so
hard that the thick silver was slowly deforming.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  Dark robes and a mask?
  <br/>
  Impossible task?
  <br/>
  Who you gonna call?
  <br/>
  HARRY POTTER!
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  Giant Fire-Ape?
  <br/>
  Old bat in a cape?
  <br/>
  Who you gonna call?
  <br/>
  HARRY POTTER!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Minerva's lips set in a white line. She would have words with
Them about that last verse, if They thought she was powerless
because it was the first day of school and Gryffindor had no points
to take away. If They didn't care about detentions then she would
find something else.
</p>
<p>
 Then, with a sudden gasp of horror, she looked in Snape's
direction,
 <em>
  surely
 </em>
 he realised the Potter boy must have no
idea who that was talking about -
</p>
<p>
 Snape's face had gone beyond rage into a kind of pleasant
indifference. A faint smile played about his lips. He was looking
in the direction of Harry Potter, not the Gryffindor table, and his
hands held the crumpled remains of a former wine goblet...
</p>
<p>
 And Harry walked forwards, sweeping his arms and legs through
the motions of the Ghostbusters dance, keeping a smile on his face.
It was a great setup, had caught him completely by surprise. The
least he could do was play along and not ruin it all.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone was cheering him. It made him feel all warm inside and
sort of awful at the same time.
</p>
<p>
 They were cheering him for a job he'd done when he was one year
old. A job he hadn't really finished. Somewhere, somehow, the Dark
Lord was still alive. Would they have been cheering quite so hard,
if they knew that?
</p>
<p>
 But the Dark Lord's power
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been broken once.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry would protect them again. If there was in fact a
prophecy and that was what it said. Well, actually regardless of
what any darn prophecy said.
</p>
<p>
 All those people believing in him and cheering him - Harry
couldn't stand to let that be false. To flash and fade like so many
other child prodigies. To be a disappointment. To fail to live up
to his reputation as a symbol of the Light, never mind
 <em>
  how
 </em>
 he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, no matter how long
it took and even if it killed him, fulfill their expectations. And
then go on to
 <em>
  exceed
 </em>
 those expectations, so that people
wondered, looking back, that they had once asked so little of
him.
</p>
<p>
 And he shouted out the lie that he'd invented because it scanned
well and the song called for it:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  I ain't afraid of Dark
Lords!
  <br/>
  I ain't afraid of Dark Lords!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry took his last steps toward the Sorting Hat as the music
ended. He swept a bow to the Order of Chaos at the Gryffindor
table, and then turned and swept another bow to the other side of
the hall, and waited for the applause and giggling to die
away...

  OMAKE FILES #3: Alternate Endings of
'Self-Awareness'
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 The offer to tell the whole plot to anyone who guessed what 'has
never happened before' spurred a
 <em>
  lot
 </em>
 of interesting
attempts. The first omake below is taken directly from my personal
favorite answer, by Meteoricshipyards. The second is based on
Kazuma's suggestion for what "has never happened before", the third
on a combination of yoyoente and dougal74, the fourth on wolf550e's
review of chapter 10. The one that starts with 'K', and the one
just above that, are from DarkHeart81. The others are my own.
Anyone who wants to pick up one of my own ideas and run with them,
particularly the last one, is welcome to do so. And before I get
100 indignant complaints, yes, I am well aware that the legislative
body of the UK is the House of Commons in Parliament.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 ...In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was
genuinely
 <em>
  conscious
 </em>
 in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to
talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so:
 <em>
  Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I
work one day...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the
stool and
 <em>
  carefully
 </em>
 placed onto his head the 800-year-old
telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.
</p>
<p>
 Thinking, just as hard as he could:
 <em>
  Don't Sort me yet! I
have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did
you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me
about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to
the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is
that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important
questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me
anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created
you?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And the Sorting Hat answered, "
 <em>
  No. Yes. No. No. Yes and no,
next time don't ask double questions. No.
 </em>
 " and out loud,
"RAVENCLAW!"
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I'm allergic to your hair shampoo -"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And then the Sorting Hat sneezed, with a mighty "A-CHOO!" that
echoed around the Great Hall.
</p>
<p>
 "Well!" Dumbledore cried jovially. "It seems Harry Potter has
been sorted into the new House of Achoo! McGonagall, you can serve
as the Head of House Achoo. You'd better hurry up on making
arrangements for Achoo's curriculum and classes, tomorrow is the
first day!"
</p>
<p>
 "But, but, but," stammered McGonagall, her mind in nearly
complete disarray, "who will be Head of House Gryffindor?" It was
all she could think of, she
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 to stop this
somehow...
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore put a finger to his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"Snape."
</p>
<p>
 Snape's screech of protest nearly drowned out McGonagall's,
"Then who will be Head of
 <em>
  Slytherin?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Hagrid."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Don't Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have
I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a

bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those
are the most important questions, but if you've got another moment
can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics
that created you?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a brief pause.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Hello? Do I need to repeat the questions?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The Sorting Hat screamed, an awful high-pitched sound that
echoed through the Great Hall and caused most of the students to
clap their hands over their ears. With a desperate yowl, it leapt
off Harry Potter's head and bounded across the floor, pushing
itself along with its brim, and made it halfway to the Head Table
before it exploded.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">%</p>
<p>
 "SLYTHERIN!"
</p>
<p>
 Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter's face, Fred Weasley
thought faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he
whipped out his wand, whispered
 <em>
  "Silencio!"
 </em>
 and then
"
 <em>

 </em>
 and finally
"
 <em>
  Ventriliquo!

<p class="sequence-break">`</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

<p>
 <em>

 <em>
  "Ordinarily I would refer such questions to the Headmaster,

 Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell off the stool
with a dull thud.
</p>
<p>
 "RAVENCLAW!" called out the Hat from where it lay on top of his
head. That had been even funnier than its first idea.

<p class="sequence-break">%</p>
<p>
 "ELF!"

 Huh? Harry remembered Draco mentioning a 'House Elf', but what

<p>
 At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small
metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as he idly
compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver
wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a
white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos
had infected the Sorting Hat itself.
</p>
<p>
 Scenario after scenario played out through Minerva's head, each
worse than the last. The Hat would say that Harry was too evenly
balanced between Houses to Sort, and decide that he belonged to all
of them. The Hat would proclaim that Harry's mind was too strange
to be Sorted. The Hat would demand that Harry be expelled from
Hogwarts. The Hat had gone into a coma. The Hat would insist that a
whole new House of Doom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter,
and
 <em>
  Dumbledore would make her do it...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Minerva remembered what Harry had told her in that disastrous
trip to Diagon Alley, about the... planning fallacy, she thought it
had been... and how people were usually too optimistic, even when
they thought they were being pessimistic. It was the sort of
information that preyed on your mind, dwelling in it and spinning
off nightmares...
</p>
<p>
 But what was the
 <em>
  worst
 </em>
 that could happen?
</p>
<p>
 Well... in the
 <em>
  worst-case scenario,
 </em>
 the Hat would
assign Harry to a whole new House. Dumbledore would insist that she
do it - create a whole new House just for him - and she'd have to
rearrange all the class schedules on the first day of term. And
Dumbledore would remove her as Head of House Gryffindor, and give
her beloved House over to... Professor Binns, the History ghost;
and she would be assigned as Head of Harry's House of Doom; and she
would futilely try to give the child orders, deducting point after
point without effect, while disaster after disaster was blamed on
her.
</p>
<p>
 Was that the worst-case scenario?
</p>
<p>
 Minerva honestly didn't see how it could be any worse than
that.
</p>
<p>
 And even in the very worst case - no matter
 <em>
  what
 </em>
 happened with Harry - it would all be over in seven years.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva felt her knuckles slowly relax their white-knuckled grip
on the podium. Harry had been right, there was a kind of comfort in
staring directly into the furthest depths of the darkness, knowing
that you had confronted your worst fears and were now prepared.
</p>
<p>
 The frightened silence was broken by a single word.
</p>
<p>
 "Headmaster!" called the Sorting Hat.
</p>
<p>
 At the Head Table, Dumbledore rose, his face puzzled. "Yes?" he
addressed the Hat. "What is it?"
</p>
<p>
 "I wasn't talking to you," said the Hat. "I was Sorting Harry
Potter into the place in Hogwarts where he most belongs, namely the
Headmaster's office -"

 "Turpin, Lisa!"
</p>
<p>
 Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherin
whisper whisper no seriously what the hell whisper whisper
</p>
<p>
 "RAVENCLAW!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry joined in the applause greeting the young girl walking
shyly towards the Ravenclaw table, her robes' trim now changed to
dark blue. Lisa Turpin appeared torn between her impulse to sit
down as far away from Harry Potter as possible, and her impulse to
run over, forcibly insert herself at his side and start tearing
answers out of him.
</p>
<p>
 Being at the center of an extraordinary and curious event, and
then being Sorted into House Ravenclaw, was closely akin to being
dipped in barbecue sauce and flung into a pit of starving
kittens.
</p>
<p>
 "I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about it," whispered
Harry for the umpteenth time.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, really."
</p>
<p>
 "No, I really did promise the Sorting Hat not to talk about
it."
</p>
<p>
 "Fine, I promised the Sorting Hat not to talk about
 <em>
  most
 </em>
 of it and the rest is
 <em>
  private
 </em>
 just like
 <em>
  yours was
 </em>
 so
 <em>
  stop asking.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "You want to know what happened? Fine! Here's part of what
happened! I told the Hat that Professor McGonagall threatened to
set it on fire and it told me to tell Professor McGonagall that she
was an impudent youngster and she should get off its lawn!"
</p>
<p>
 "If you're not going to believe what I say then
 <em>
  why are you
even asking?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "No, I don't know how I defeated the Dark Lord either! You tell
me if you figure it out!"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Silence!
 </em>
 " shouted Professor McGonagall at the podium
of the Head Table. "
 <em>
  No talking until the Sorting Ceremony
finishes!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was a brief dip in the volume, as everyone waited to see
if she was going to make any specific and credible threats, and
then the whispers started up again.
</p>
<p>
 Then the silver-bearded ancient stood up from his great golden
chair, smiling cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
 Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry as he tried
to continue a whisper, and Harry cut himself off in
mid-sentence.
</p>
<p>
 The cheerful-looking old man sat down again.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Note to self: Do not mess with Dumbledore.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened
during the Incident with the Sorting Hat. Not the least of which
was what had happened the instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his
head; in that moment, he'd heard a tiny whisper as though from
nowhere, something that sounded oddly like English and a hiss at
the same time, something that had said, "
 <em>
  Ssalutations from
Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak
to my ssnake."
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry was sorta guessing that wasn't supposed to be part of the
official Sorting process. And that it was a bit of extra magic set
down by Salazar Slytherin during the making of the Hat. And that
the Hat itself didn't know about it. And that it was triggered when
the Hat said "SLYTHERIN", plus or minus some other conditions. And
that a Ravenclaw like himself
 <em>
  really, really wasn't supposed to
have heard it
 </em>
 . And that if he could find some reliable way of
swearing Draco to secrecy so he could ask him about it, that would
be an excellent time to have some Comed-Tea handy.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Boy, you resolve not to go down the path of a Dark Lord and
the universe starts messing with you the instant the Hat comes off
your head. Some days it just doesn't pay to fight destiny. Maybe
I'll wait until tomorrow to start on my resolution to not be a Dark
Lord.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "GRYFFINDOR!"
</p>
<p>
 Ron Weasley got a
 <em>
  lot
 </em>
 of applause, and not just from
the Gryffindors. Apparently the Weasley family was widely liked
around here. Harry, after a moment, smiled and started applauding
along with the others.
</p>
<p>
 Then again, there was no time like today to turn back from the
Dark Side.
</p>
<p>
 Stuff destiny and stuff the universe. He'd show that Hat.
</p>
<p>
 "Zabini, Blaise!"
</p>
<p>
 Pause.
</p>
<p>
 "SLYTHERIN!" shouted the hat.
</p>
<p>
 Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring the odd looks he was
getting from everyone including Zabini.
</p>
<p>
 No other name was called out after that, and Harry realised that
"Zabini, Blaise" did sound close to the end of the alphabet. Great,
so now he'd
 <em>
  only
 </em>
 applauded Zabini... Oh well.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore got up again and began heading towards the podium.
Apparently they were about to be treated to a speech -
</p>
<p>
 And Harry was struck by the inspiration for a
 <em>
  brilliant
 </em>
 experimental test.
</p>
<p>
 Hermione had said that Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard
alive, right?
</p>
<p>
 Harry reached into his pouch and whispered, "Comed-Tea".
</p>
<p>
 For the Comed-Tea to work, it would have to make Dumbledore say
something
 <em>
  so
 </em>
 ridiculous during his speech that even in
Harry's state of mental preparedness, he would
 <em>
  still
 </em>
 choke. Like, all the Hogwarts students had to not wear any clothes
for the whole school year, or everyone was going to be transformed
into cats.
</p>
<p>
 But then if
 <em>
  anyone in the world
 </em>
 could resist the power
of the Comed-Tea, it would be Dumbledore. So if this worked, the
Comed-Tea was literally
 <em>
  invincible.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry pulled the ring on the Comed-Tea under the table, wanting
to do this a bit unobtrusively. The can made a quiet hissing noise.
A few heads turned to look at him, but soon turned back as -
</p>
<p>
 "Welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!" said Dumbledore,
beaming at the students with his arms opened wide, as if nothing
could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
</p>
<p>
 Harry took a first mouthful of Comed-Tea and lowered the can
again. He would swallow the pop a little at a time and try not to
choke no matter
 <em>
  what
 </em>
 Dumbledore said -
</p>
<p>
 "Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.
And here they are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank
you!"
</p>
<p>
 Everyone clapped and cheered, and Dumbledore sat down again.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sat frozen as pop trickled out of the corners of his
mouth. He had, at least, managed to choke
 <em>
  quietly
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 He really really
 <em>
  really
 </em>
 shouldn't have done that.
Amazing how much
 <em>
  more obvious
 </em>
 that became
 <em>
  one
second
 </em>
 after it was
 <em>
  too late
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In retrospect he probably should have noticed something wrong
when he was thinking about everyone being turned into cats... or
even before then, remembered his mental note not to mess with
Dumbledore... or his newfound resolution to be more considerate of
others... or maybe if he'd had
 <em>
  one single scrap
 </em>
 of
 <em>
  common sense
 </em>
 ...
</p>
<p>
 It was hopeless. He was corrupt to the core. Hail the Dark Lord
Harry. You couldn't fight fate.
</p>
<p>
 Someone was asking Harry if he was all right. (Others were
starting to serve themselves food, which had magically appeared on
the table, whatever.)
</p>
<p>
 "I'm all right," Harry said. "Excuse me. Um. Was that a...
 <em>
  normal
 </em>
 speech for the Headmaster? You all... didn't
seem... very surprised..."
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, Dumbledore's insane, of course," said an older-looking
Ravenclaw sitting next to him who had introduced himself with some
name Harry didn't even begin to remember. "Lots of fun, incredibly
powerful wizard, but completely bonkers." He paused. "At some later
point I'd also like to ask why green fluid came out of your lips
and then disappeared, though I expect you promised the Sorting Hat
not to talk about that either."
</p>
<p>
 With a great effort, Harry stopped himself from glancing down at
the incriminating can of Comed-Tea in his hand.
</p>
<p>
 After all, the Comed-Tea hadn't just arbitrarily
 <em>
  materialised
 </em>
 a Quibbler headline about him and Draco.
Draco had explained it in a way that made it seem like it had all
happened... naturally? As if it had
 <em>
  altered history to
fit?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry was mentally imagining himself banging his forehead
against the table.
 <em>
  Wham, wham, wham
 </em>
 went his head within
his mind.
</p>
<p>
 Another student lowered her voice to a whisper. "I hear that
Dumbledore is secretly a genius mastermind controlling lots of
stuff and he uses the insanity as a cover so that no one will
suspect him."
</p>
<p>
 "I've heard that too," whispered a third student, and there were
furtive nods from around the table.
</p>
<p>
 This couldn't help but catch Harry's attention.
</p>
<p>
 "I see," whispered Harry, lowering his own voice. "So everyone
knows that Dumbledore is secretly a mastermind."
</p>
<p>
 Most of the students nodded. One or two looked suddenly
thoughtful, including the older student sitting next to Harry.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Are you sure this is the Ravenclaw table?
 </em>
 Harry managed
not to ask out loud.
</p>
<p>
 "Brilliant!" Harry whispered. "If everyone knows, no one will
suspect it's a secret!"
</p>
<p>
 "Exactly," whispered a student, and then he frowned. "Wait, that
doesn't sound quite right -"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Note to self: The 75th percentile of Hogwarts students
a.k.a. Ravenclaw House is not the world's most exclusive program
for gifted children.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 But at least he'd learned an important fact today. The Comed-Tea
was omnipotent. And
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 meant...
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked in surprise as his mind finally made the obvious
connection.
</p>
<p>
 ...
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 meant that as soon as he learned a spell to
temporarily alter his own sense of humor, he could make
 <em>
  anything
 </em>
 happen, by making it so that he would
 <em>
  only
 </em>
 find that
 <em>
  one thing
 </em>
 surprising enough to do
a spit-take, and then drinking a can of Comed-Tea.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Well that was a short little journey to godhood. Even I
expected this to take longer than my first day of school.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Come to think of it, he had also completely wrecked Hogwarts
within ten minutes flat of getting Sorted.
</p>
<p>
 Harry did feel a certain amount of regret about this - Merlin
knew what an insane Headmaster was going to do to his next seven
years of schooling - but he couldn't
 <em>
  help
 </em>
 feeling a twinge
of pride, too.
</p>
<p>
 Tomorrow. No later than tomorrow at the very latest he was going
to stop walking down the path that led to Dark Lord Harry. A
prospect which was sounding scarier by the minute.
</p>
<p>
 And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part of his mind
was already visualising the minions' uniforms.
</p>
<p>
 "Eat," the older student sitting next to him growled, and jabbed
Harry in the ribs. "Don't think. Eat."
</p>
<p>
 Harry automatically started loading up his plate with whatever
was in front of him, blue sausages with tiny glowing bits,
whatever.
</p>
<p>
 "What were you thinking about, the Sorting -" began to say Padma
Patil, one of the other first-year Ravenclaws.
</p>
<p>
 "No pestering during mealtimes!" chorused at least three people.
"House Rule!" added another. "Otherwise we'd all starve around
here."
</p>
<p>
 Harry was finding himself really, really hoping that his clever
new idea didn't
 <em>
  actually
 </em>
 work. And that the Comed-Tea
worked some other way and didn't
 <em>
  actually
 </em>
 have the
omnipotent power to alter reality. It wasn't that he didn't
 <em>
  want
 </em>
 to be omnipotent. It was that he just couldn't bear
the thought of living in a universe that really worked like that.
There was something
 <em>
  undignified
 </em>
 about ascending through
the clever use of fizzy drinks.
</p>
<p>
 But he
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 going to test it experimentally.
</p>
<p>
 "You know," said the older student next to him in a quite
pleasant tone, "we have a system for forcing people like you to
eat, would you like to find out what it is?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave up and started eating his blue sausage. It was quite
good, especially the glowing bits.
</p>
<p>
 Dinner passed with surprising rapidity. Harry tried to sample at
least a little of all the weird new foods he saw. His curiosity
couldn't stand the thought of
 <em>
  not knowing
 </em>
 how something
tasted. Thank goodness this wasn't a restaurant where you had to
order only one thing and you never found out what all the other
things on the menu tasted like. Harry
 <em>
  hated
 </em>
 that, it was
like a torture chamber for anyone with a spark of curiosity:
 <em>
  Find out about only one of the mysteries on this list, ha ha
ha!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Then it was time for dessert, which Harry had completely
forgotten to leave room for. He gave up after sampling a small bit
of treacle tart. Surely all these things would pass around at least
once again over the course of the school year.
</p>
<p>
 So what was on his to-do list, besides the ordinary school
things?
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms so you can test the
Comed-Tea and see whether you actually did figure out a path to
omnipotence. Actually, just research every kind of mind magic you
can find. Mind is the foundation of our power as humans, any kind
of magic that affects it is the most important sort of magic there
is.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  To-do 2. Actually this is To-do 1 and the other is To-do 2.
Go through the bookshelves of the Hogwarts and Ravenclaw libraries,
familiarising yourself with the system and making sure you've at
least read all the book titles. Second pass: read all tables of
contents. Coordinate with Hermione who has a much better memory
than you. Find out if there's an interlibrary loan system at
Hogwarts and see if the two of you, especially Hermione, can visit
those libraries too. If other Houses have private libraries, figure
out how to access legally or sneak in.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Option 3a: Swear Hermione to secrecy and try to start
researching 'From Slytherin to Slytherin: if you would seek my
secrets, speak to my snake.' Problem: This sounds highly
confidential and it could take quite a while to randomly run across
a book containing a hint.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  To-do 0: Check out what sort of
information-search-and-retrieval spells exist, if any. Library
magic isn't as ultimately important as mind magic but it has a much
higher priority.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Option 3b: Look for a spell to magically bind Draco Malfoy
to secrecy, or magically verify the sincerity of Draco's promise to
keep a secret (Veritaserum?), and then ask
 </em>
 him
 <em>
  about
Slytherin's message...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Actually... Harry had a pretty bad feeling about option 3b.
</p>
<p>
 Now that Harry thought about it, he didn't feel all that great
about option 3a, either.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's thoughts flashed back to possibly the worst moment of
his life to date, those long seconds of blood-freezing horror
beneath the Hat, when he thought he'd already failed. He'd wished
then to fall back just a few minutes in time and change something,
anything before it was too late...
</p>
<p>
 And then it had turned out to not be too late after all.
</p>
<p>
 Wish granted.
</p>
<p>
 You couldn't change history. But you could get it right to start
with. Do something differently the
 <em>
  first
 </em>
 time around.
</p>
<p>
 This whole business with seeking Slytherin's secrets... seemed
an awful lot like the sort of thing where, years later, you would
look back and say, 'And
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 was where it all started
going wrong.'
</p>
<p>
 And he would wish desperately for the ability to fall back
through time and make a different choice...
</p>
<p>
 Wish granted. Now what?
</p>
<p>
 Harry slowly smiled.
</p>
<p>
 It was a rather
 <em>
  counterintuitive
 </em>
 thought... but...
</p>
<p>
 But he
 <em>
  could,
 </em>
 there was no rule saying he couldn't, he
 <em>
  could
 </em>
 just pretend he'd never heard that little whisper.
Let the universe go on in exactly the same way it would have if
that one critical moment had never occurred. Twenty years later,
that was what he would desperately wish had happened twenty years
ago, and twenty years before twenty years later happened to be
right now. Altering the distant past was easy, you just had to
think of it at the right time.
</p>
<p>
 Or... this was even
 <em>
  more
 </em>
 counterintuitive... he could
even inform, oh, say,
 <em>
  Professor McGonagall,
 </em>
 instead of
Draco
 <em>
  or
 </em>
 Hermione. And she could get a few good people
together and get that little extra spell taken off the Hat.
</p>
<p>
 Why, yes. That sounded like a
 <em>
  remarkably
 </em>
 good idea once
Harry had actually
 <em>
  thought
 </em>
 of it.
</p>
<p>
 So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and
Option 3d just hadn't occurred to him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry awarded himself +1 point on his anti-Dark-Lord-Harry
program.
</p>
<p>
 It had been an awfully cruel prank the Hat had played on him,
but you couldn't argue with the results on consequentialist
grounds. It certainly did give him a better idea of the victim's
perspective, though.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  To-do 4: Apologise to Neville Longbottom.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Okay, he was on a roll here, now he just had to keep it up.
 <em>
  In every day, in every way, I'm getting Lighter and
Lighter...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 People around Harry had also mostly stopped eating at this
point, and the dessert serving dishes began to vanish, and the used
plates.
</p>
<p>
 When all the plates were gone, Dumbledore once again stood up
from his seat.
</p>
<p>
 Harry couldn't help but feel the urge to drink another
Comed-Tea.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You've GOT to be kidding,
 </em>
 Harry thought at that piece
of himself.
</p>
<p>
 But the experiment didn't count if it wasn't replicated, did it?
And the damage was already done, wasn't it? Didn't he want to see
what would happen
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 time? Wasn't he
 <em>
  curious?
 </em>
 What if he got a different result?
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Hey, I bet you're the same part of my brain that pushed
through the prank on Neville Longbottom.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Er, maybe?
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  And is it not
 </em>
 overwhelmingly
 <em>
  obvious that if I do
this I shall regret it one second after it is too late?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Um...
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yeah. So, NO.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Ahem," said Dumbledore from the podium, stroking his long
silver beard. "Just a few more words now that we are all fed and
watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."
</p>
<p>
 "First years should note that the forest on the grounds is
forbidden to all pupils. That is why it is called the Forbidden
Forest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted
Forest."
</p>
<p>
 Straightforward.
 <em>
  Note to self: Forbidden Forest is
forbidden.

</p>
<p>
 "I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind
you all that no magic should be used between classes in the

  is
 </em>
 , are two different things. Thank you for keeping this
in mind."
</p>
<p>
 Er...
</p>
<p>
 "Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact
Madam Hooch. Anyone interested in reformulating the entire game of
Quidditch should contact Harry Potter."
</p>
<p>
 Harry inhaled his own saliva and went into a coughing fit just
as all eyes turned towards him. How the
 <em>
  hell!
 </em>
 He hadn't
met Dumbledore's eyes at any point... he didn't
 <em>
  think.
 </em>
 He
certainly hadn't been thinking about Quidditch at the time! He
hadn't talked to anyone but Ron Weasley and he didn't
 <em>
  think
 </em>
 Ron would have told anyone else... or had Ron run
off to a professor to complain?
 <em>
  How
 </em>
 on
 <em>
  Earth...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Additionally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor
corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who
does not wish to die a very painful death. It is guarded by an
elaborate series of dangerous and potentially lethal traps, and you
cannot possibly get past all of them, especially if you are only in
your first year."
</p>
<p>
 Harry was numb at this point.
</p>
<p>
 "And finally, I extend my greatest thanks to Quirinus Quirrell
for heroically agreeing to undertake the position of Defence
Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts." Dumbledore's gaze
moved searchingly across the students. "I hope all students will
extend Professor Quirrell that utmost courtesy and
 <em>
  tolerance
 </em>
 which is due his extraordinary service to you
and this school, and that you
 <em>
  will not pester us
 </em>
 with any
 <em>
  niggling complaints
 </em>
 about him, unless
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 want to
try doing his job."
</p>
<p>
 What was
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 about?
</p>
<p>
 "I now yield the floor to our new faculty member Professor
Quirrell, who would like to say a few words."
</p>
<p>
 The young, thin, nervous man who Harry had first met in the
Leaky Cauldron slowly made his way up to the podium, glancing
fearfully around in all directions. Harry caught a glimpse of the
back of his head, and it looked like Professor Quirrell might
already be going bald, despite his seeming youth.
</p>
<p>
 "Wonder what's wrong with
 <em>
  him,
 </em>
 " whispered the
older-looking student sitting next to Harry. Similar hushed
comments were being exchanged elsewhere along the table.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell made his way up to the podium and stood
there, blinking. "Ah..." he said. "Ah..." Then his courage seemed
to fail him utterly, and he stood there in silence, occasionally
twitching.
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, great," whispered the older student, "looks like another
 <em>
  long
 </em>
 year in Defence class -"
</p>
<p>
 "Salutations, my young apprentices," Professor Quirrell said in
a dry, confident tone. "We all know that Hogwarts tends to suffer a
certain
 <em>
  misfortune
 </em>
 in its selections for this position,
and no doubt many of you are already wondering what doom shall
befall me this year. I assure you, that doom is not to be my
incompetence." He smiled thinly. "Believe it or not, I have long
wished to someday try my hand as the Professor of Defence Against
the Dark Arts here at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. The first to teach this class was Salazar Slytherin
himself, and as late as the fourteenth century it was traditional
for the greatest fighting wizards of every persuasion to try their
hands at teaching here. Past Professors of Defence have included
not just the legendary wandering hero Harold Shea but also the
quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see some of you are still
shuddering at the sound of her name even though she's been dead for
six hundred years. That must have been an interesting time to
attend Hogwarts, don't you think?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was swallowing hard, trying to suppress the sudden surge
of emotion that had overcome him when Professor Quirrell had begun
speaking. The precise tones reminded him very much of a lecturer at
Oxford, and it was starting to hit home that Harry wasn't going to
see his home or his Mum or his Dad until Christmas.
</p>
<p>
 "You are accustomed to the Defence position being filled by
incompetents, scoundrels, and the unlucky. To anyone with a sense
of history, it bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone who
teaches here has been the best, but the best have all taught at
Hogwarts. In such august company, and after so much time
anticipating this day, I would be ashamed to set myself any
standard lower than perfection. And so I do intend that every one
of you will always remember this year as the
 <em>
  best
 </em>
 Defence
class that you have ever had. What you learn this year will forever
serve as your firm foundation in the arts of Defence, no matter who
your teachers before and after."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's expression grew serious. "We have a
 <em>
  great
 </em>
 deal of lost ground to make up and not much time to
cover it. Therefore I intend to depart from Hogwarts teaching
conventions in a number of respects, as well as introducing some
optional after-school activities." He paused. "If that is not
sufficient, perhaps I can find new ways to motivate you. You are my
long-awaited students, and you
 <em>
  will
 </em>
 do your
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 best in my long-awaited Defence class. I would add some sort of
dreadful threat, like 'Otherwise you will suffer horribly', but
that would be so cliched, don't you think? I pride myself on being
more imaginative than that. Thank you."
</p>
<p>
 Then the vigour and confidence seemed to drain away from
Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open as if he had suddenly
found himself facing an unexpected audience, and he turned with a
convulsive jerk and shuffled back to his seat, hunched over as if
he was about to collapse in on himself and implode.
</p>
<p>
 "He seems a little odd," whispered Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "Meh," said the older-looking student. "You ain't seen
nothin'."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore resumed the podium.
</p>
<p>
 "And now," said Dumbledore, "before we go to bed, let us sing
the school song! Everyone pick their favourite tune and favourite
words, and off we go!"

 EDIT: Don't panic. I solemnly swear that there is a logical,

<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever
heard."
 </em>
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 As soon as Harry opened his eyes in the Ravenclaw first-year
boys' dormitory, on the morning of his first full day at Hogwarts,
he knew something was wrong.
</p>
<p>
 It was quiet.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Too
 </em>
 quiet.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, right... There was a Quietus Charm on his bed's headboard,
controlled by a small slider bar, which was the only reason it was
ever possible for anyone to go to sleep in Ravenclaw.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sat up and looked around, expecting to see others rising
for the day -
</p>
<p>
 The dorm, empty.
</p>
<p>
 The beds, rumpled and unmade.
</p>
<p>
 The sun, coming in at a rather high angle.
</p>
<p>
 His Quieter turned all the way up to maximum.
</p>
<p>
 And his mechanical alarm clock was still running, but the alarm
was turned off.
</p>
<p>
 He'd been allowed to sleep until 9:52 AM, apparently. Despite
his best efforts to synchronize his 26-hour sleep cycle to his
arrival at Hogwarts, he hadn't gotten to sleep last night until
around 1AM. He'd been planning to wake up at 7:00AM with the other
students, he could stand being a little sleep-deprived his first
day so long as he got some sort of magical fix before tomorrow. But
now he'd missed breakfast. And his very first class at Hogwarts, in
Herbology, had started one hour and twenty-two minutes ago.
</p>
<p>
 The anger was slowly, slowly wakening in him. Oh, what a nice
little prank. Turn off his alarm. Turn up the Quieter. And let Mr.
Bigshot Harry Potter miss his first class, and be blamed for being
a heavy sleeper.
</p>
<p>
 When Harry found out who'd done this...
</p>
<p>
 No, this could only have been done with the cooperation of all
twelve other boys in the Ravenclaw dorm. All of them would have
seen his sleeping form. All of them had let him sleep through
breakfast.
</p>
<p>
 The anger drained away, replaced by confusion and a horribly
wounded feeling. They'd
 <em>
  liked
 </em>
 him. He'd thought. Last
night, he'd thought they liked him.
 <em>
  Why...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 As Harry stepped out of the bed, he saw a piece of paper facing
out from his headboard.
</p>
<p>
 The paper said,
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  My fellow Ravenclaws,
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  It's been an extra long day. Please let me sleep in and
don't worry about my missing breakfast. I haven't forgotten about
my first class.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yours,
  <br/>
  Harry Potter.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning to trickle
through his veins.
</p>
<p>
 The paper was in his own handwriting, in his own mechanical
pencil.
</p>
<p>
 And he didn't remember writing it.
</p>
<p>
 And... Harry squinted at the piece of paper. And unless he was
imagining it, the words "I haven't forgotten" were written in a
different style, as if he was trying to tell himself
something...?
</p>
<p>
 Had he
 <em>
  known
 </em>
 he was going to be Obliviated? Had he
stayed up late, committed some sort of crime or covert activity,
and then... but he didn't
 <em>
  know
 </em>
 the Obliviate spell... had
someone else... what...
</p>
<p>
 A thought occurred to Harry. If he
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 known he was
going to be Obliviated...
</p>
<p>
 Still in his pyjamas, Harry ran around his bed to his trunk,
pressed his thumb against the lock, pulled out his pouch, stuck in
his hand and said "Note to myself."
</p>
<p>
 And another piece of paper popped into his hand.
</p>
<p>
 Harry took it out, staring at it. It too was in his own
handwriting.
</p>
<p>
 The note said:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Dear Me,
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Recognition code 927, I am a potato.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yours,
  <br/>
  You.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded slowly. "Recognition code 927, I am a potato" was
indeed the message he had worked out in advance - some years
earlier, while watching TV - that only he would know. If he had to
identify a duplicate of himself as being really
 <em>
  him,
 </em>
 or
something. Just in case. Be Prepared.
</p>
<p>
 Harry couldn't
 <em>
  trust
 </em>
 the message, there might be other
spells involved. But it ruled out any simple prank. He had
definitely written this and he definitely didn't remember writing
it.
</p>
<p>
 Staring at the paper, Harry became aware of ink showing through
from the other side.
</p>
<p>
 He flipped it over.
</p>
<p>
 The reverse side read:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
GAME:
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  you do not know the rules of the
game
  <br/>
  you do not know the stakes of the game
  <br/>
  you do not know the objective of the game
 </em>
 <em>
  <br/>
  you do not know who controls the game
  <br/>
  you do not know how to end the game
 </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <em>
  You start with 100 points.
  <br/>
  Begin.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared at the "instructions". This side wasn't
handwritten; the writing was perfectly regular, hence artificial.
It looked as if it had been inscribed by a Quotes Quill, such as
the one he'd bought to take dictation.
</p>
<p>
 He had
 <em>
  absolutely no clue
 </em>
 what was going on.
</p>
<p>
 Well... step one was to get dressed and eat. Maybe reverse the
order of that. His stomach felt rather empty.
</p>
<p>
 He'd missed breakfast, of course, but he was Prepared for that
eventuality, having visualised it in advance. Harry put his hand
into his pouch and said "Snack bars", expecting to get the box of
cereal bars he'd bought before departing for Hogwarts.
</p>
<p>
 What popped up did not feel like a box of cereal bars.
</p>
<p>
 When Harry brought his hand into his field of vision he saw two
tiny candy bars - not nearly enough for a meal - attached to a
note, and the note was inscribed in the same writing as the game
instructions.
</p>
<p>
 The note said:
</p>
<p>
 ATTEMPT FAILED: -1 POINT
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: 99
 <br/>
 PHYSICAL STATE: STILL HUNGRY
 <br/>
 MENTAL STATE: CONFUSED
</p>
<p>
 "Gleehhhhh" Harry's mouth said without any sort of conscious
intervention or decision on his part.
</p>
<p>
 He stood there for around a minute.
</p>
<p>
 One minute later, it
 <em>
  still
 </em>
 didn't make any sense and he
 <em>
  still
 </em>
 had absolutely no idea what was going on and his
brain hadn't even
 <em>
  begun
 </em>
 to grasp at any
 <em>
  hypotheses
 </em>
 like his mental hands were encased in rubber
balls and couldn't pick anything up.
</p>
<p>
 His stomach, which had its own priorities, suggested a possible
experimental probe.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said to the empty room. "I don't suppose I could
spend a point and get my box of cereal bars back?"
</p>
<p>
 There was only silence.
</p>
<p>
 Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "Box of cereal
bars."
</p>
<p>
 A box that felt like the right shape popped up into his hand...
but it was too light, and it was open, and it was empty, and the
note attached to it said:
</p>
<p>
 POINTS SPENT: 1
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: 98
 <br/>
 YOU HAVE GAINED: A BOX OF CEREAL BARS
</p>
<p>
 "I'd like to spend one point and get the
 <em>
  actual cereal
bars
 </em>
 back," said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 Again, silence.
</p>
<p>
 Harry put his hand into the pouch and said "cereal bars".
</p>
<p>
 Nothing came up.
</p>
<p>
 Harry shrugged despairingly and went over to the cabinet he'd
been given near his bed, to get his wizard's robes for the day.
</p>
<p>
 On the floor of the cabinet, under his robes, were the cereal
bars, and a note:
</p>
<p>
 POINTS SPENT: 1
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: 97
 <br/>
 YOU HAVE GAINED: 6 CEREAL BARS
 <br/>
 YOU ARE STILL WEARING: PYJAMAS
 <br/>
 DO NOT EAT WHILE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR PYJAMAS
 <br/>
 YOU WILL GET A PYJAMA PENALTY
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  And now I know that whoever controls the game is
insane.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "My guess is that the game is controlled by Dumbledore," Harry
said out loud. Maybe
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 time he could set a new land
speed record for being quick on the uptake.
</p>
<p>
 Silence.
</p>
<p>
 But Harry was starting to pick up the pattern; the note would be
in the next place he looked. So Harry looked under his bed.
</p>
<p>
 HA! HA HA HA HA HA!
 <br/>
 HA HA HA HA HA HA!
 <br/>
 HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
 <br/>
 DUMBLEDORE DOES NOT CONTROL THE GAME
 <br/>
 BAD GUESS
 <br/>
 VERY BAD GUESS
 <br/>
 -20 POINTS
 <br/>
 AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS
 <br/>
 IT IS YOUR FOURTH MOVE
 <br/>
 AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS
 <br/>
 PYJAMA PENALTY: -2 POINTS
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: 75
</p>
<p>
 Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day
at school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the
name of anyone else here who was this crazy.
</p>
<p>
 His body more or less on autopilot, Harry gathered up a set of
robes and underwear, pulled out the cavern level of his trunk (he
was a very private sort of person and someone might walk into the
dorm), got dressed, and then went back upstairs to put away his
pyjamas.
</p>
<p>
 Harry paused before pulling out the cabinet drawer that held his
pyjamas. If the pattern here held true...
</p>
<p>
 "How can I earn more points?" Harry said out loud.
</p>
<p>
 Then he pulled out the drawer.
</p>
<p>
 OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD ARE EVERYWHERE
 <br/>
 BUT DARKNESS IS WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE
 <br/>
 COST OF QUESTION: 1 POINT
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: 74
 <br/>
 NICE UNDERWEAR
 <br/>
 DID YOUR MOTHER PICK THEM OUT?
</p>
<p>
 Harry crushed the note in his hand, face flaming scarlet.
Draco's curse came back to him.
 <em>
  Son of a mudblood -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 At this point he knew better than to say it out loud. He would
probably get a Profanity Penalty.
</p>
<p>
 Harry girded himself with his mokeskin pouch and wand. He peeled
off the wrapper of one his cereal bars and threw it into the room's
rubbish bin, where it landed atop a mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog,
a crumpled envelope and some green and red wrapping paper. He put
the other cereal bars into his mokeskin pouch.
</p>
<p>
 He looked around in a final, desperate, and ultimately futile
search for clues.
</p>
<p>
 And then Harry left the dorm, eating as he went, in search of
the Slytherin dungeons. At least that was what he
 <em>
  thought
 </em>
 the line was about.
</p>
<p>
 Trying to navigate the halls of Hogwarts was like... probably
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 quite as bad as wandering around inside an Escher
painting, that was the sort of thing you said for rhetorical effect
rather than for its being true.
</p>
<p>
 A short time later, Harry was thinking that in fact an Escher
painting would have both pluses and minuses compared to Hogwarts.
Minuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least
the stairs wouldn't move around
 <em>
  WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON
THEM.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry had originally climbed four flights of stairs to get to
his dorm. After clambering down no fewer than twelve flights of
stairs without getting anywhere near the dungeons, Harry had
concluded that (1) an Escher painting would be a
 <em>
  cakewalk
 </em>
 by comparison, (2) he was somehow
 <em>
  higher
 </em>
 in the castle
than when he'd started, and (3) he was so
 <em>
  thoroughly
 </em>
 lost
that he wouldn't have been surprised to look out of the next window
and see two moons in the sky.
</p>
<p>
 Backup plan A had been to stop and ask for directions, but there
seemed to be an extreme lack of people wandering around, as if the
beggars were all attending class the way they were supposed to or
something.
</p>
<p>
 Backup plan B...
</p>
<p>
 "I'm lost," Harry said out loud. "Can, um, the spirit of the
Hogwarts castle help me or something?"
</p>
<p>
 "I don't think this castle has a spirit," observed a wizened old
lady in one of the paintings on the walls. "Life, perhaps, but not
spirit."
</p>
<p>
 There was a brief pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Are you -" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second
thought, no he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was
fully conscious in the sense of being aware of its own
awareness.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm Harry Potter," said his mouth, more or less on autopilot.
Also more or less automatically, Harry stuck out a hand towards the
painting.
</p>
<p>
 The woman in the painting looked down at Harry's hand and raised
her eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, the hand dropped back to Harry's side.
</p>
<p>
 "Sorry," Harry said, "I'm sort of new here."
</p>
<p>
 "So I perceive, young raven. Where are you trying to go?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry hesitated. "I'm not really sure," he said.
</p>
<p>
 "Then perhaps you are already there."
</p>
<p>
 "Well, wherever I
 <em>
  am
 </em>
 trying to go, I don't think
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 is it..." Harry shut his mouth, aware of just how
much he was sounding like an idiot. "Let me start over. I'm playing
this game only I don't know what the rules are -" That didn't
really work either, did it. "Okay, third try. I'm looking for
opportunities to do good so I can score points, and all I have is
this cryptic hint about how darkness is where the light needs to
be, so I was trying to go down but I seem to keep going up
instead..."
</p>
<p>
 The old lady in the painting was looking at him rather
sceptically.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sighed. "My life tends to get a bit peculiar."
</p>
<p>
 "Would it be fair to say that you don't know where you're going
or why you're trying to get there?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Entirely
 </em>
 fair."
</p>
<p>
 The old lady nodded. "I'm not sure that being lost is your most
important problem, young man."
</p>
<p>
 "True, but unlike the more important problems, it's a problem I
can understand how to solve and
 <em>
  wow
 </em>
 is this conversation
turning into a metaphor for human existence, I didn't even realise
that was happening until just now."
</p>
<p>
 The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. "You
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 a fine young
raven, aren't you? For a moment I was starting to wonder. Well
then, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're bound
to keep going down."
</p>
<p>
 That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where
he'd heard it before. "Um... you seem like a very intelligent
person. Or a picture of a very intelligent person... anyway, have
you heard of a mysterious game where you can only play once, and
they won't tell you the rules?"
</p>
<p>
 "Life," said the lady at once. "That's one of the most obvious
riddles I've ever heard."
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked. "No," he said slowly. "I mean I got an actual
note and everything saying that I had to play the game but I
wouldn't be told the rules, and someone is leaving me little slips
of paper telling me how many points I've lost for violating the
rules, like a minus two point penalty for wearing pyjamas. Do you
know anyone here at Hogwarts who's crazy enough and powerful enough
to do something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?"
</p>
<p>
 The picture of a lady sighed. "I'm only a picture, young man. I
remember Hogwarts as it was - not Hogwarts as it is. All I can tell
you is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be that the
game is life, and that while we do not make all the rules
ourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it
is not riddle but reality - then I do not know."
</p>
<p>
 Harry bowed very low to the picture. "Thank you, milady."
</p>
<p>
 The lady curtseyed to him. "I wish I could say that I'll
remember you with fondness," she said, "but I probably won't
remember you at all. Farewell, Harry Potter."
</p>
<p>
 He bowed again in reply, and started to climb down the nearest
flight of stairs.
</p>
<p>
 Four left turns later he found himself staring down a corridor
that ended, abruptly, in a tumbled mound of large rocks - as if
there had been a cave-in, only the surrounding walls and ceiling
were intact and made of quite regular castle stones.
</p>
<p>
 "All right," Harry said to the empty air, "I give up. I'm asking
for another hint. How do I get to where I need to go?"
</p>
<p>
 "A hint! A hint, you say?"
</p>
<p>
 The excited voice came from a painting on the wall not far away,
this one a portrait of a middle-aged man in the loudest pink robes
that Harry had ever seen or even imagined. In the portrait he was
wearing a droopy old pointed hat with a fish on it (not a drawing
of a fish, mind, but a fish).
</p>
<p>
 "Yes!" Harry said. "A hint! A hint, I say! Only not just
 <em>
  any
 </em>
 hint, I'm looking for a
 <em>
  specific
 </em>
 hint, it's
for a game I'm playing -"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, yes! A hint for the game! You're Harry Potter, aren't you?
I'm Cornelion Flubberwalt! I was told by Erin the Consort who was
told by Lord Weaselnose who was told by, I forget really. But it
was a message for
 <em>
  me
 </em>
 to give to you! For
 <em>
  me!
 </em>
 No
one's cared about me in, I don't know how long, maybe ever, I've
been stuck down here in this bloody useless old corridor - a hint!
I have your hint! It will only cost you three points! Do you want
it?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes! I want it!" Harry was aware that he probably ought to keep
his sarcasm under control but he just couldn't seem to help
himself.
</p>
<p>
 "The darkness can be found between the green study rooms and
McGonagall's Transfiguration class! That's the hint! And get a move
on, you're slower than a sack of snails! Minus ten points for being
slow! Now you have 61 points! That was the rest of the
message!"
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you," Harry said. He was really getting behind on the
game here. "Um... I don't suppose you know where the message
 <em>
  originally
 </em>
 came from, do you?"
</p>
<p>
 "It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap
within the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's
what they told me!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was no longer sure, at this point, whether this was the
sort of thing he ought to be sceptical about, or the sort of thing
he should just take in stride. "And how can I find the line between
the green study rooms and Transfiguration class?"
</p>
<p>
 "Just spin back around and go left, right, down, down, right,
left, right, up, and left again, you'll be at the green study room
and if you go in and walk straight out the opposite side you'll be
on a big curvy corridor that goes to an intersection and on the
right side of that intersection will be a long straight hallway
that goes to the Transfiguration classroom!" The figure of the
middle-aged man paused. "At least that's how it was when
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 was in Hogwarts. This
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 a Monday on an odd-numbered year,
isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
 "Pencil and mechanical paper," Harry said to his pouch. "Er,
cancel that, paper and mechanical pencil." He looked up. "Could you
repeat that?"
</p>
<p>
 After getting lost another two times, Harry felt that he was
beginning to understand the basic rule for navigating the
ever-changing maze that was Hogwarts, namely,
 <em>
  ask a painting
for directions
 </em>
 . If this reflected some sort of incredibly deep
life lesson he couldn't figure out what it was.
</p>
<p>
 The green study room was a surprisingly pleasant space with
sunlight streaming in from windows of green-stained glass that
showed dragons in calm, pastoral scenes. It had chairs that looked
extremely comfortable, and tables that seemed very well-suited to
studying in the company of one to three friends.
</p>
<p>
 Harry couldn't
 <em>
  actually
 </em>
 walk straight through and out
the door on the other side. There were
 <em>
  bookshelves
 </em>
 set
into the wall, and he had to go over and read some of the titles,
so as to not lose his claim to the Verres family name. But he did
it quickly, mindful of the complaint about being slow, and then
went out the other side.
</p>
<p>
 He was walking down the "big curvy corridor" when he heard a
young boy's voice cry out.
</p>
<p>
 At times like this, Harry had an excuse to sprint all-out with
no regards for saving energy or doing proper warmup exercises or
worrying about crashing into things, a sudden frantic flight that
nearly came to an equally sudden halt as he almost ran over a group
of six first-year Hufflepuffs...
</p>
<p>
 ...who were huddled together, looking rather scared and like
they desperately wanted to do something but couldn't figure out
what, which probably had something to do with the group of five
older Slytherins who seemed to be surrounding another young
boy.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was suddenly rather angry.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Excuse me!
 </em>
 " shouted Harry at the top of his
lungs.
</p>
<p>
 It might not have been necessary. People were already looking at
him. But it certainly served to stop all the action cold.
</p>
<p>
 Harry walked past the cluster of Hufflepuffs towards the
Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 They looked down at him with expressions that ranged from anger
to amusement to delight.
</p>
<p>
 Part of Harry's brain was screaming in panic that these were
much older and bigger boys who could stomp him flat.
</p>
<p>
 Another part said dryly that anyone caught seriously stomping
the Boy-Who-Lived was in for a whole
 <em>
  world
 </em>
 of trouble,
especially if they were a pack of older Slytherins and there were
seven Hufflepuffs who saw it, and that the chance of them doing him
any permanent damage in the presence of witnesses was nearly zero.
The only real weapon the older boys had against him was his own
fear, if he allowed that.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry saw that the boy they had trapped was Neville
Longbottom.
</p>
<p>
 Of course.
</p>
<p>
 That settled it. Harry had decided to apologise humbly to
Neville and that meant Neville was
 <em>
  his
 </em>
 , how
 <em>
  dare
 </em>
 they?
</p>
<p>
 Harry reached out and grabbed Neville by the wrist and
 <em>
  yanked
 </em>
 him out from between the Slytherins, the boy
stumbling in shock as Harry pulled him out and in nearly the same
motion pushed his own way through the same gap.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry stood in the center of the Slytherins where Neville
had stood, looking up at the much older, larger, and stronger
boys.
</p>
<p>
 "Hello," Harry said. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."
</p>
<p>
 There was a rather awkward pause. No one seemed to know where
the conversation was supposed to go from there.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's eyes dropped downwards and saw some books and papers
scattered around the floor. Oh, the old game where you let the boy
try to pick up his books and then knock them out of his hand again.
Harry couldn't remember ever being the object of that game himself,
but he had a good imagination and his imagination was making him
furious. Well, once the larger situation was resolved it would be
easy enough for Neville to come back and pick up his materials,
provided that the Slytherins stayed too intent on him to think of
doing anything to the books.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately his straying eyes had been noted. "Ooh," said the
largest of the boys, "did 'oo want the widdle books -"
</p>
<p>
 "Shut up," Harry said coldly.
 <em>
  Keep them off balance. Don't
do what they expect. Don't fall into a pattern that calls for them
to bully you.
 </em>
 "Is this part of some incredibly clever plan
that will gain you future advantage, or is it as pointless a
disgrace to the name of Salazar Slytherin as it -"
</p>
<p>
 The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, and he went sprawling
out of the circle of Slytherins onto the hard stone floor of
Hogwarts.
</p>
<p>
 And the Slytherins laughed.
</p>
<p>
 Harry rose up in what seemed to him like terribly slow motion.
He didn't know yet how to use his wand, but there was no reason to
let that stop him, under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
 "I'd like to pay
 <em>
  as many points as it takes
 </em>
 to get rid
of this person," Harry said, pointing with his finger to the
largest Slytherin.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry lifted his other hand, said "Abracadabra," and
snapped his fingers.
</p>
<p>
 At the word
 <em>
  Abracadabra
 </em>
 two of the Hufflepuffs
screamed, including Neville, three other Slytherins leapt
desperately out of the way of Harry's finger, and the largest
Slytherin staggered back with an expression of shock, a sudden
splash of red decorating his face and neck and chest.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 been expecting
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled
off the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him. The
largest Slytherin held the pan in his hand for a moment, staring at
it, then dropped it to the floor.
</p>
<p>
 It probably wasn't the best time in the world for one of the
Hufflepuffs to start laughing, but that was exactly what one of the
Hufflepuffs was doing.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry caught sight of the note on the bottom of the
pan.
</p>
<p>
 "Hold on," Harry said, and darted forward to pick up the note.
"This note's for me, I think -"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  You,"
 </em>
 growled the largest Slytherin, "
 <em>
  you, are,
going, to -
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Look
 </em>
 at this!" shouted Harry, brandishing the note at
the older Slytherin. "I mean, just
 <em>
  look
 </em>
 at this! Can you
believe I'm being charged 30 points for shipping and handling on
one lousy pie? 30 points! I'm turning a loss on the deal even after
rescuing an innocent boy in distress! And storage fees? Conveyance
charges? Drayage costs? How do you get
 <em>
  drayage costs
 </em>
 on a
 <em>
  pie?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was another one of those awkward pauses. Harry thought
deadly thoughts at whichever Hufflepuff couldn't seem to stop
giggling, that idiot was going to get him hurt.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stepped back and shot the Slytherins his best lethal
glare. "Now go away or I will just keep making your existence more
and more surreal until you do. Let me warn you... messing with
 <em>
  my
 </em>
 life tends to make
 <em>
  your
 </em>
 life...
 <em>
  a little
hairy.
 </em>
 Get it?"
</p>
<p>
 In a single terrible motion, the largest Slytherin whipped his
wand out to point at Harry and in the same instant was hit on the
other side of his head by another pie, this one bright
blueberry.
</p>
<p>
 The note on this pie was rather large and clearly readable. "You
might want to read the note on that pie," Harry observed. "I think
it's for you this time."
</p>
<p>
 The Slytherin slowly reached up, took the pie pan, turned it
over with a wet glop that dropped more blueberry on the floor, and
read a note that said:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  WARNING
 </span>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  NO
 </span>
 MAGIC MAY BE
USED ON THE CONTESTANT
 <br/>
 WHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS
 <br/>
 FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE GAME
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  WILL
 </span>
 BE REPORTED TO
THE GAME AUTHORITIES
</p>
<p>
 The expression of sheer bafflement on the Slytherin's face was a
look of art. Harry thought that he might be starting to like this
Game Controller.
</p>
<p>
 "Look," Harry said, "you want to call it a day? I think things
are spiralling out of control here. How about you go back to
Slytherin and I go back to Ravenclaw and we all just cool down a
bit, okay?"
</p>
<p>
 "I've got a better idea," hissed the largest Slytherin. "How
about if you accidentally break all your fingers?"
</p>
<p>
 "How in Merlin's name do you stage a believable accident after
making the threat in front of a dozen witnesses, you
 <em>
  idiot
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached out towards
Harry's hands, and Harry froze in place, the part of his brain that
was noticing the other boy's age and strength finally managing to
make itself heard, screaming,
 <em>
  WHAT THE HECK AM I
DOING?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Wait!" said one of the other Slytherins, his voice suddenly
panicky. "Stop, you shouldn't actually do that!"
</p>
<p>
 The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry's right hand
firmly in his left hand, and taking Harry's index finger in his
right hand.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared the Slytherin straight in the eyes. Part of Harry
was screaming, this wasn't supposed to happen, this wasn't
 <em>
  allowed
 </em>
 to happen, grownups would never let something like
this
 <em>
  actually
 </em>
 happen -
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, the Slytherin started to bend his index finger
backwards.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  He hasn't actually broken my finger and it is beneath me to
so much as flinch until he does. Until then, this is just another
attempt to cause fear.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Stop!" said the Slytherin who had objected before. "Stop, this
is a very bad idea!"
</p>
<p>
 "I rather agree," said an icy voice. An older woman's voice.
</p>
<p>
 The largest Slytherin let go of Harry's hand and jumped
backwards as if burned.
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Sprout!" cried one of the Hufflepuffs, sounding as
glad as anyone Harry had ever heard in his life.
</p>
<p>
 Into Harry's field of vision, as he turned, stalked a dumpy
little woman with messily curled grey hair and clothes covered with
dirt. She pointed an accusing finger at the Slytherins. "Explain
yourselves," she said. "What are you doing with my Hufflepuffs
and..." she looked at him. "My fine student, Harry Potter."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Uh oh. That's right, it was HER class I missed this
morning.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "He threatened to kill us!" blurted one of the other Slytherins,
the same one who'd called for a halt.
</p>
<p>
 "What?" Harry said blankly. "I did
 <em>
  not!
 </em>
 If I was going
to kill you I wouldn't make public threats first!"
</p>
<p>
 A third Slytherin laughed helplessly and then stopped abruptly
as the other boys shot him deadly glares.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Sprout had adopted a rather sceptical expression.
"What death threat would this be, exactly?"
</p>
<p>
 "The Killing Curse! He pretended to use the Killing Curse on
us!"
</p>
<p>
 Professor Sprout turned to look at Harry. "Yes, quite a terrible
threat from an eleven-year-old boy. Though still not something you
should
 <em>
  ever
 </em>
 dream of pretending, Harry Potter."
</p>
<p>
 "I don't even know the
 <em>
  words
 </em>
 to the Killing Curse,"
Harry said promptly. "And I didn't have my wand out at any
time."
</p>
<p>
 Now Professor Sprout was giving Harry a sceptical look. "I
suppose this boy hit
 <em>
  himself
 </em>
 with two pies, then."
</p>
<p>
 "He
 <em>
  didn't
 </em>
 use his wand!" blurted one of the young
Hufflepuffs. "I don't know how he did it either, he just snapped
his fingers and there was pie!"
</p>
<p>
 "Really," said Professor Sprout after a pause. She drew her own
wand. "I won't require it, since you do seem to be the victim here,
but would you mind if I checked your wand to verify that?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry took out his wand. "What do I -"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Prior Incantato,
 </em>
 " said Sprout. She frowned. "That's
odd, your wand doesn't seem to have been used at all."
</p>
<p>
 Harry shrugged. "It hasn't, actually, I only got my wand and
schoolbooks a few days ago."
</p>
<p>
 Sprout nodded. "Then we have a clear case of accidental magic
from a boy who felt threatened. And the rules plainly state that
you are not to be held responsible. As for
 <em>
  you...
 </em>
 " she
turned to the Slytherins. Her eyes dropped deliberately to
Neville's books lying on the floor.
</p>
<p>
 There was a long silence during which she looked at the five
Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 "Three points from Slytherin,
 <em>
  each
 </em>
 ," she said finally.
"And six from
 <em>
  him,
 </em>
 " pointing to the boy covered in pie.
"Don't you
 <em>
  ever
 </em>
 meddle with my Hufflepuffs again, or my
student Harry Potter either. Now
 <em>
  go.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 She didn't have to repeat herself; the Slytherins turned and
walked away very quickly.
</p>
<p>
 Neville went and started picking up his books. He seemed to be
crying, but only a little. It might have been from delayed shock,
or it might have been because the other boys were helping him.
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 much, Harry Potter," Professor Sprout
said to him. "Seven points to Ravenclaw, one for each Hufflepuff
you helped protect. And I won't say anything more."
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked. He'd been expecting something more along the
lines of a lecture about keeping himself out of trouble, and a
rather severe scolding for missing his very first class.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe he
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 have gone to Hufflepuff. Sprout was
cool.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Scourgify,
 </em>
 " Sprout said to the mess of pie on the
floor, which promptly vanished.
</p>
<p>
 And she left, walking along the hall that led to the green study
room.
</p>
<p>
 "How did you
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 that?" hissed one of the Hufflepuff
boys as soon as she was gone.
</p>
<p>
 Harry smiled smugly. "I can make anything I want happen just by
snapping my fingers."
</p>
<p>
 The boy's eyes widened. "
 <em>
  Really?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "No," said Harry. "But when you're telling everyone this story
be sure to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw,
she has an anecdote you might find amusing." He had absolutely no
clue what was happening, but he wasn't about to pass up the
opportunity to add to his growing legend. "Oh, and what was all
that about the Killing Curse?"
</p>
<p>
 The boy gave him a strange look. "You really don't know?"
</p>
<p>
 "If I did, I wouldn't be asking."
</p>
<p>
 "The words to the Killing Curse are," the boy swallowed, and his
voice dropped to a whisper, and he held his hands away from his
sides as if to make it very clear that he wasn't holding a wand,
"
 <em>
  Avada Kedavra.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Well of course they are.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry put this on his growing list of things to never ever tell
his Dad, Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It was bad enough talking
about how you were the only person to survive the fearsome Killing
Curse, without having to admit that the Killing Curse was
"Abracadabra."
</p>
<p>
 "I see," Harry said after a pause. "Well, that's the last time I
ever say
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 before snapping my fingers." Though it
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 produced an effect that might be tactically
useful.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Why
 </em>
 did you -"
</p>
<p>
 "Raised by Muggles, Muggles think it's a joke and that it's
funny. Seriously, that's what happened. Sorry, but can you remind
me of your name?"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm Ernie Macmillan," said the Hufflepuff. He held out his
hand, and Harry shook it. "Honoured to meet you."
</p>
<p>
 Harry executed a slight bow. "Pleased to meet you, skip the
honoured thing."
</p>
<p>
 Then the other boys crowded round him and there was a sudden
flood of introductions.
</p>
<p>
 When they were done, Harry swallowed. This was going to be very
difficult. "Um... if everyone would excuse me... I have something
to say to Neville -"
</p>
<p>
 All eyes turned to Neville, who took a step back, his face
looking apprehensive.
</p>
<p>
 "I suppose," Neville said in a tiny voice, "you're going to say
I should've been braver -"
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, no, nothing like that!" Harry said hastily. "Nothing to do
with
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 . It's just, um, something the Sorting Hat told
me -"
</p>
<p>
 Suddenly the other boys looked
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 interested, except
for Neville, who was looking even
 <em>
  more
 </em>
 apprehensive.
</p>
<p>
 There seemed to be something blocking Harry's throat. He knew he
should just blurt it out, and it was like he'd swallowed a large
brick that was just stuck in the way.
</p>
<p>
 It was like Harry had to manually take control of his lips and
produce each syllable individually, but he managed to make it
happen. "I'm, sor, ry." He exhaled and took a deep breath. "For
what I did, um, the other day. You... don't have to be gracious
about it or anything, I'll understand if you just hate me. This
isn't about me trying to look cool by apologising or your having to
accept it. What I did was wrong."
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause.
</p>
<p>
 Neville clutched his books tighter to his chest. "Why did you do
it?" he said in a thin, wavering voice. He blinked, as if trying to
hold back tears. "Why does
 <em>
  everyone
 </em>
 do that to me, even
the Boy-Who-Lived?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry suddenly felt smaller than he ever had in his life. "I'm
sorry," Harry said again, his voice now hoarsened. "It's just...
you looked so scared, it was like a sign over your head saying
'victim', and I wanted to show you that things
 <em>
  don't
 </em>
 always turn out badly, that sometimes the monsters give you
chocolate... I thought if I showed you that, you might realise
there wasn't so much to be afraid of -"
</p>
<p>
 "But there
 <em>
  is,
 </em>
 " whispered Neville. "You saw it today,
there
 <em>
  is!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "They wouldn't have done anything really bad in front of
witnesses. Their main weapon is fear. That's why they target
 <em>
  you,
 </em>
 because they can see you're afraid. I wanted to make
you less afraid... show you that the fear was worse than the thing
itself... or that was what I told myself, but the Sorting Hat told
me that I was lying to myself and that I really did it because it
was fun. So that's why I'm apologising -"
</p>
<p>
 "You hurt me," said Neville. "Just now. When you grabbed me and
pulled me away from them." Neville held out his arm and pointed to
where Harry had grabbed him. "I might have a bruise here later from
how hard you pulled. You hurt me worse than anything the Slytherins
did by bumping into me, actually."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Neville!
 </em>
 " hissed Ernie. "He was trying to
 <em>
  save
 </em>
 you!"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry," whispered Harry. "When I saw that I just got...
really angry..."
</p>
<p>
 Neville looked at him steadily. "So you yanked me out really
hard and put yourself in where I was and went, 'Hello, I'm the
Boy-Who-Lived'."
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded.
</p>
<p>
 "I think you're going to be really cool someday," Neville said.
"But right now, you're not."
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed the sudden knot in his throat and walked away.
He continued down the corridor to the intersection, then turned
left into a hallway and kept on walking, blindly.
</p>
<p>
 What was he
 <em>
  supposed
 </em>
 to do here? Never get angry? He
wasn't sure he could have done anything without being angry and who
knows what would have happened to Neville and his books then.
Besides, Harry had read enough fantasy books to know how
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 one went. He would try to suppress the anger and he
would fail and it would keep coming out again. And after this whole
long journey of self-discovery he would learn at the end that his
anger was a part of himself and that only by accepting it could he
learn to use it wisely.
 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 was the only universe in
which the answer actually
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 that you were supposed to
cut yourself off completely from negative emotions, and something
about Yoda had always made Harry hate the little green moron.
</p>
<p>
 So the obvious time-saving plan was to skip the journey of
self-discovery and go straight to the part where he realised that
only by accepting his anger as a part of himself could he stay in
control of it.
</p>
<p>
 The problem was that he didn't
 <em>
  feel
 </em>
 out of control when
he was angry. The cold rage made him feel like he was
 <em>
  in
 </em>
 control. It was only when he looked back that
 <em>
  events as a
whole
 </em>
 seemed to have... blown up out of control, somehow.
</p>
<p>
 He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort
of thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself
felt like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old
lady in the picture would have told him that his was the only
opinion that mattered.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry was also wondering whether the Game Controller had
sent Professor Sprout. It was the logical thought: the note had
threatened to notify the Game Authorities, and then there Professor
Sprout was. Maybe Professor Sprout
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 the Game Controller
- the
 <em>
  Head of House Hufflepuff
 </em>
 would be the
 <em>
  last
 </em>
 person anyone would suspect, which ought to put her near the top of
Harry's list. He'd read one or two mystery novels, too.
</p>
<p>
 "So how am I doing in the game?" Harry said out loud.
</p>
<p>
 A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it
from behind him - Harry turned around, but there was no one there -
and when Harry turned forwards again, the note was settling to the
floor.
</p>
<p>
 The note said:
</p>
<p>
 POINTS FOR STYLE: 10
 <br/>
 POINTS FOR GOOD THINKING: -3,000,000
 <br/>
 RAVENCLAW HOUSE POINTS BONUS: 70
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: -2,999,871
 <br/>
 TURNS REMAINING: 2
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Minus three million points?"
 </em>
 Harry said indignantly to
the empty hallway. "That seems excessive! I want to file an appeal
with the Game Authorities! And how am I supposed to make up three
million points in the next two turns?"
</p>
<p>
 Another note flew over his head.
</p>
<p>
 APPEAL: FAILED
 <br/>
 ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS
 <br/>
 CURRENT POINTS: -1,000,002,999,871
 <br/>
 TURNS REMAINING: 1
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave up. With one turn remaining all he could do was take
his best shot, even if it wasn't very good. "My guess is that the
game represents life."
</p>
<p>
 A final sheet of paper flew over his head, reading:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 ATTEMPT FAILED

 FINAL INSTRUCTION:
 <em>

  go to Professor McGonagall's office
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The last line was in his own handwriting.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared at the last line for a while, then shrugged. Fine.
Professor McGonagall's office it would be. If
 <em>
  she
 </em>
 was the
Game Controller...
</p>
<p>
 Okay, honestly, Harry had absolutely no idea how he would feel
if Professor McGonagall was the Game Controller. His mind was just
drawing a complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.
</p>
<p>
 A couple of portraits later - it wasn't a long trip, Professor
McGonagall's office wasn't far from her Transfiguration classroom,
at least not on Mondays on odd-numbered years - Harry stood outside
the door to her office.
</p>
<p>
 He knocked.
</p>
<p>
 "Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.
</p>
<p>
 He entered.
</p>

</div><div class="chapter"><h2 id="14">Chapter 14</h2><h3>The Unknown and the Unknowable</h3>
<p>
 Melenkurion abatha! Duroc minas mill J. K. Rowling!
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">%</p>
<p>
 <em>
  There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious answer was
a contradiction in terms.
 </em>
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 "Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.
</p>
<p>
 Harry did so.
</p>
<p>
 The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and
well-organised; on the wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a
maze of wooden cubbyholes of all shapes and sizes, most with
several parchment scrolls thrust into them, and it was somehow very
clear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what every cubbyhole
meant, even if no one else did. A single parchment lay on the
actual desk, which was, aside from that, clean. Behind the desk was
a closed door barred with several locks.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the
desk, looking puzzled - her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight
note of apprehension, as she saw Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall. "What is this
about?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry's mind went blank. He'd been instructed by the game to
come here, he had been expecting
 <em>
  her
 </em>
 to have something in
mind...
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall, starting to look
slightly annoyed.
</p>
<p>
 Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered at this point
that he
 <em>
  did
 </em>
 have something he'd been planning to discuss
with Professor McGonagall. Something important and well worth her
time.
</p>
<p>
 "Um..." Harry said. "If there are any spells you can cast to
make sure no one's listening to us..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the
outer door, and began taking out her wand and saying spells.
</p>
<p>
 It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a
priceless and possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor
McGonagall a Comed-Tea and he couldn't believe he was seriously
thinking that and it would be fine the soda would vanish after a
few seconds and he told that part of himself to
 <em>
  shut
up.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going
to say. He hadn't planned to have this discussion
 <em>
  quite
 </em>
 so
soon, but so long as he was here...
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older
than Latin, and then she sat down again.
</p>
<p>
 "All right," she said in a quiet voice. "No one's listening."
Her face was rather tight.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for
information about the prophecy.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Eh, Harry'd get around to that some other day.
</p>
<p>
 "It's about the Incident with the Sorting Hat," Harry said.
(Professor McGonagall blinked.) "Um... I think there's an extra
spell on the Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself
doesn't know about, something that triggers when the Sorting Hat
says Slytherin. I heard a message that I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws
aren't supposed to hear. It came the moment the Sorting Hat was off
my head and I felt the connection break. It sounded like a hiss and
like English at the same time," there was a sharp intake of breath
from McGonagall, "and it said: Salutations from Slytherin to
Slytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
Harry as if he'd grown another two heads.
</p>
<p>
 "So..." Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn't
believe the words that were coming out of her own lips, "you
decided to come to me right away and tell me about it."
</p>
<p>
 "Well, yes, of course," Harry said. There was no need to admit
how long it had taken him to actually think of that. "As opposed
to, say, trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other
children."
</p>
<p>
 "I... see," Professor McGonagall said. "And if, perhaps, you
were to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's legendary
Chamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you alone could
open..."
</p>
<p>
 "I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a
team of experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,"
Harry said promptly. "Then I would open up the entrance again and
they would go in very carefully to make sure that there was nothing
dangerous. I might go in later to look around, or if they needed me
to open up something else, but it would be after the area had been
declared clear and they had photographs of how everything looked
before people started tromping around their priceless historical
site."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at
him like he'd just turned into a cat.
</p>
<p>
 "It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said
kindly.
</p>
<p>
 "I think," Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice,
"that you
 <em>
  far
 </em>
 underestimate the rarity of common sense,
Mr. Potter."
</p>
<p>
 That sounded about right. Although... "A Hufflepuff would've
said the same thing."
</p>
<p>
 McGonagall paused, struck. "
 <em>
  That's
 </em>
 true."
</p>
<p>
 "Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff."
</p>
<p>
 She blinked at him as though she couldn't believe her own ears.
"Did it
 <em>
  really?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Yes."
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, "five
decades ago was the last time a student died within the walls of
Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last
time someone heard that message."
</p>
<p>
 A chill went through Harry. "Then I will be
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 sure
to take no action
 <em>
  whatsoever
 </em>
 on this matter without
consulting you, Professor McGonagall." He paused. "And may I
suggest that you get together the best people you can find and see
if it's possible to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat... and
if you can't do that, maybe put on
 <em>
  another
 </em>
 spell, a
Quietus that briefly activates just as the Hat is being removed
from a student's head, that might work as a patch. There, no more
dead students." Harry nodded in satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing
were imaginable. "I cannot
 <em>
  possibly
 </em>
 award you enough
points for this without giving the House Cup to Ravenclaw
outright."
</p>
<p>
 "Um," Harry said. "Um. I'd rather not earn
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 many
House points."
</p>
<p>
 Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look. "Why
not?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words.
"Because it would be just too sad, you know? Like... like back when
I was still trying to go to school in the Muggle world, and
whenever there was a group project, I'd go ahead and do the whole
thing myself because the others would only slow me down. I'm fine
with earning lots of points, more than anyone else even, but if I
earn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just by myself,
then it's like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that's
too sad."
</p>
<p>
 "I see..." McGonagall said hesitantly. It was apparent that this
way of thinking had never occurred to her. "Suppose I only awarded
you fifty points, then?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children
if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of
and they can't. How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for
reporting a whisper he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be
fair at all."
</p>
<p>
 "I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff," said
Professor McGonagall. She was eyeing him with a strange
respect.
</p>
<p>
 That made Harry choke up a bit. He'd honestly thought he wasn't
worthy of Hufflepuff. That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to
shove him anywhere but Ravenclaw, into a House whose virtues he
didn't have...
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall was smiling now. "And if I tried to give
you
 <em>
  ten
 </em>
 points...?"
</p>
<p>
 "Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if
anyone asks? There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don't mean
the children at Hogwarts, who would be really
 <em>
  really
 </em>
 angry
if they knew about the spell being taken off the Sorting Hat and
found out I was involved. So I think that absolute secrecy is the
better part of valour. No need to thank me, ma'am, virtue is its
own reward."
</p>
<p>
 "So it is," Professor McGonagall said, "but I do have a very
special something else to give you. I see that I have greatly
wronged you in my thoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here."
</p>
<p>
 She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand,
and a sort of blurry curtain sprang up around her. Harry could
neither see nor hear what was going on. It was a few minutes later
that the blur vanished and Professor McGonagall was standing there,
facing him, with the door behind her looking as though it hadn't
ever been opened.
</p>
<p>
 And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thin
golden chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which
was the device of an hourglass. In her other hand was a folded
pamphlet. "This is for you," she said.
</p>
<p>
 Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a
quest reward! Apparently that business with refusing offers of
monetary rewards until you got a magic item actually worked in real
life, not just computer games.
</p>
<p>
 Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling. "What is it?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall took a breath. "Mr. Potter, this is an item
which is ordinarily lent only to children who have already shown
themselves to be highly responsible, in order to help them with
difficult class schedules." McGonagall hesitated, as though about
to add something else. "I
 <em>
  must
 </em>
 emphasise, Mr. Potter, that
this item's true nature is
 <em>
  secret
 </em>
 and that you must
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 tell any of the other students about it, or let them
see you using it. If that's not acceptable to you, then you can
give it back now."
</p>
<p>
 "I can keep secrets," Harry said. "So what does it do?"
</p>
<p>
 "So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster
wicket and it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical
ailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear it under your
clothes, and while you have no reason to show it to anyone, you
also have no reason to treat it as an awful secret. Spimster
wickets are not interesting. Do you understand, Mr. Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded, his smile widening. He sensed the work of a
 <em>
  competent
 </em>
 Slytherin. "And what does it
 <em>
  really
 </em>
 do?"
</p>
<p>
 "It's a Time-Turner. Each spin of the hourglass sends you one
hour back in time. So if you use it to go back two hours every day,
you should always be able to get to sleep at the same time."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's suspension of disbelief blew completely out the
window.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You're giving me a time machine to treat my sleep
disorder.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You're giving me a TIME MACHINE to treat my SLEEP
DISORDER.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  YOU'RE
  <strong>
   GIVING ME A TIME MACHINE
  </strong>
  IN ORDER TO
  <strong>
   TREAT MY SLEEP DISORDER
  </strong>
  .
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Ehehehehhheheh..." Harry's mouth said. He was now holding the
necklace away from him as though it were a live bomb. Well, no, not
as if it were a live bomb, that didn't
 <em>
  begin
 </em>
 to describe
the severity of the situation. Harry held the necklace away from
him as though it were a time machine.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed
ordinary matter looks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did
you know that one kilogram of antimatter encountering one kilogram
of matter will annihilate in an explosion equivalent to 43 million
tons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself weigh 41 kilograms and
that the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER WHERE
THERE USED TO BE SCOTLAND?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me," Harry managed to say, "but this sounds really
really
 <em>
  really REALLY DANGEROUS!
 </em>
 " Harry's voice didn't
quite rise to a shriek, he couldn't possibly scream loud enough to
do this situation justice so there was no point in trying.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection.
"I'm glad you're taking this seriously, Mr. Potter, but
Time-Turners aren't
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 dangerous. We wouldn't give them
to children if they were."
</p>
<p>
 "Really," Harry said. "Ahahahaha. Of course you wouldn't give
time machines to children if they were dangerous, what
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 I thinking? So just to be clear, sneezing on this device will
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 send me into the Middle Ages where I will run over
Gutenberg with a horse cart and prevent the Enlightenment? Because,
you know, I hate it when that happens to me."
</p>
<p>
 McGonagall's lips were twitching in that way she had when she
was trying not to smile. She offered Harry the pamphlet she was
holding, but Harry was carefully holding out the necklace with both
hands and staring at the hourglass to make sure it wasn't about to
turn. "Don't worry," McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when
it became clear that Harry wasn't going to move, "that can't
possibly happen, Mr. Potter. The Time-Turner cannot be used to move
more than six hours backwards. It can't be used more than six times
in any day."
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, good, very good, that. And if someone bumps into me the
Time-Turner will
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 break and will
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 trap the
whole castle of Hogwarts in an endlessly repeating loop of
Thursdays."
</p>
<p>
 "Well, they
 <em>
  can
 </em>
 be fragile..." said McGonagall. "And I
do think I've heard about strange things happening if they're
broken. But nothing like
 <em>
  that!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Perhaps," Harry said when he could speak again, "you ought to
provide your time machines with some sort of
 <em>
  protective
shell
 </em>
 , rather than
 <em>
  leaving the glass exposed
 </em>
 , so as
to
 <em>
  prevent that from happening
 </em>
 ."
</p>
<p>
 McGonagall looked quite struck. "That's an excellent idea, Mr.
Potter. I shall inform the Ministry of it."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  That's it, it's official now, they've ratified it in
Parliament, everyone in the wizarding world is completely
stupid.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "And while I hate to get all
 <em>
  PHILOSOPHICAL,
 </em>
 " Harry
desperately tried to lower his voice to something under a shriek,
"has anyone thought about the
 <em>
  IMPLICATIONS
 </em>
 of going back
six hours and doing something that changes time which would pretty
much
 <em>
  DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  REPLACE THEM
WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS -
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, you can't
 <em>
  change
 </em>
 time!" Professor McGonagall
interrupted. "Good heavens, Mr. Potter, do you think these would be
allowed students if
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 was possible? What if someone
tried to change their test scores?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry took a moment to process this. His hands relaxed, just a
little, from their white grip on the hourglass chain. Like he
wasn't holding a time machine, just a live nuclear warhead.
</p>
<p>
 "So..." Harry said slowly. "People just find that the
universe... happens to be self-consistent, somehow, even though it
has time-travel in it. If I and my future self interact then I'll
see the same thing as both of me, even though, on my own first run
through, my future self is already acting in full knowledge of
things that, from my own perspective, haven't happened yet..."
Harry's voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.
</p>
<p>
 "Correct, I think," said Professor McGonagall. "Although wizards
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 advised to avoid being seen by their past selves. If
you're attending two classes at the same time and you need to cross
paths with yourself, for example, the first version of you should
step aside and close his eyes at a known time - you have a watch
already, good - so that the future you can pass. It's all there in
the pamphlet."
</p>
<p>
 "Ahahahaa. And what happens when someone
 <em>
  ignores
 </em>
 that
advice?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall pursed her lips. "I understand that it can
be quite disconcerting."
</p>
<p>
 "And it doesn't, say, create a paradox that destroys the
universe."
</p>
<p>
 She smiled tolerantly. "Mr. Potter, I think I'd remember hearing
if
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 had ever happened."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  THAT IS NOT REASSURING! HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF
THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE? AND WHAT IDIOT EVER BUILT ONE OF THESE
THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It was a pleasant, glad
sound that seemed surprisingly out of place on that stern face.
"You're having another 'you turned into a cat' moment, aren't you,
Mr. Potter. You probably don't want to hear this, but it's quite
endearingly cute."
</p>
<p>
 "Turning into a cat doesn't even
 <em>
  BEGIN
 </em>
 to compare to
this. You know right up until this moment I had this awful
suppressed thought somewhere in the back of my mind that the only
remaining answer was that my whole universe was a computer
simulation like in the book
 <em>
  Simulacron 3
 </em>
 but now
 <em>
  even
that is ruled out
 </em>
 because this little toy
 <em>
  ISN'T TURING
COMPUTABLE!
 </em>
 A Turing machine could simulate going back into a
defined moment of the past and computing a different future from
there, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behavior of
lower-order machines, but what you're saying is that reality
somehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information
that hasn't... happened... yet..."
</p>
<p>
 Realisation struck Harry a pile-driver blow.
</p>
<p>
 It all made sense now. It all
 <em>
  finally
 </em>
 made sense.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS!
 </em>
 Of
 <em>
  course!
 </em>
 The spell doesn't
 <em>
  force
 </em>
 funny events to happen, it just
makes you
 <em>
  feel an impulse to drink
 </em>
 right before funny
things are going to happen anyway! I'm such a fool, I should have
realised when I felt the impulse to drink the Comed-Tea before
Dumbledore's second speech,
 <em>
  didn't
 </em>
 drink it, and then
choked on my own saliva instead - drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't
cause the comedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I
saw the two events were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to
be the cause and the comedy had to be the effect because I thought
temporal order restrained causation and causal graphs had to be
acyclic BUT IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS
GOING
 <em>
  BACKWARDS IN TIME!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Realisation struck Harry the
 <em>
  second
 </em>
 pile-driver.
</p>
<p>
 This one he managed to keep quiet, making only a small
strangling sound like a dying kitten as he realised who'd put the
note on his bed this morning.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall's eyes were alight. "After you graduate, or
possibly even before, you really
 <em>
  must
 </em>
 teach some of these
Muggle theories at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite
fascinating, even if they're all wrong."
</p>
<p>
 "Glehhahhh..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries,
demanded a few more promises to which Harry nodded, said something
about not talking to snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded
him to read the pamphlet, and then somehow Harry found himself
standing outside her office with the door closed firmly behind
him.
</p>
<p>
 "Gaahhhrrrraa..." Harry said.
</p>
<p>
 Why yes his mind
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 blown.
</p>
<p>
 Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well
have never obtained a Time-Turner in the first place.
</p>
<p>
 Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, only
later in the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep
disorder or telling her about the Sorting Hat's message? And would
he, at that time, have wanted to pull a prank on himself which
would have led to him getting the Time-Turner
 <em>
  earlier?
 </em>
 So
that the only
 <em>
  self-consistent
 </em>
 possibility was the one in
which the Prank started before he even woke up in the
morning...?
</p>
<p>
 Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life,
that the answer to his question might be literally
 <em>
  inconceivable.
 </em>
 That since his own brain contained neurons
that only ran forwards in time, there was
 <em>
  nothing
 </em>
 his
brain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate
to the operation of a Time Turner.
</p>
<p>
 Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E. T.
Jaynes that if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a
fact about your own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon
itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact
about whatever you were uncertain about; that ignorance existed in
the mind, not in reality; that a blank map did not correspond to a
blank territory. There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious
answer was a contradiction in terms. A phenomenon could be
mysterious
 <em>
  to
 </em>
 some particular person, but there could be
no phenomena mysterious of themselves. To worship a sacred mystery
was just to worship your own ignorance.
</p>
<p>
 So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.
People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and
biology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always
been the proper meat of science, that they had
 <em>
  never been
 </em>
 mysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once
called the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to
human will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery
"infinitely beyond" the reach of science. (Not just a little
beyond, mind you, but
 <em>
  infinitely
 </em>
 beyond. Lord Kelvin
certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from
 <em>
  not knowing
something
 </em>
 .) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from
the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.
</p>
<p>
 Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a
mystery that was threatening to be
 <em>
  permanent
 </em>
 . If Time
didn't work by acyclic causal networks then Harry didn't understand
what was meant by cause and effect; and if Harry didn't understand
causes and effects then he didn't understand what sort of stuff
reality might be made of instead; and it was entirely possible that
his human mind never
 <em>
  could
 </em>
 understand, because his brain
was made of
 <em>
  old-fashioned linear-time neurons,
 </em>
 and this
had turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.
</p>
<p>
 On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed
all-powerful and all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much
simpler explanation. Which he'd missed
 <em>
  merely
 </em>
 because the
truth was completely outside his hypothesis space or anything that
his brain had evolved to comprehend. But now he actually
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 figured it, probably. Which was sort of encouraging.
Sort of.
</p>
<p>
 Harry glanced down at his watch. It was nearly 11AM, he'd gotten
to sleep last night at 1AM, so in the natural state of affairs he'd
go to sleep tonight at 3AM. So to go to sleep at 10PM and wake up
at 7AM, he should go back five hours total. Which meant that if he
wanted to get back to his dorm at around 6AM, before anyone was
awake, he'd better hurry up and...
</p>
<p>
 Even in
 <em>
  retrospect
 </em>
 Harry didn't understand how he'd
pulled off
 <em>
  half
 </em>
 the stuff involved in the Prank. Where had
the
 <em>
  pie
 </em>
 come from?
</p>
<p>
 Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, he had to admit that it
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been an
irreplaceable opportunity. A prank you could only pull on yourself
once in a lifetime, within six hours of when you first found out
about Time-Turners.
</p>
<p>
 In fact that was even
 <em>
  more
 </em>
 puzzling, when Harry thought
about it. Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a
 <em>
  fait accompli,
 </em>
 and yet it was, quite clearly, his own
handiwork. Concept and execution and writing style. Every last
part, even the ones he still didn't understand.
</p>
<p>
 Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in
a day. Harry did know
 <em>
  some
 </em>
 of what he had to do, and he
might figure out the rest, like the pie, while he was working.
There was no point putting it off. He couldn't exactly accomplish
anything stuck here in the
 <em>
  future.
 </em>
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his
robes pulled up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in
case someone was already up and about and saw him at the same time
as Harry lying in his bed. He didn't want to have to explain to
anyone about his little medical problem with Spontaneous
Duplication.
</p>
<p>
 Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.
</p>
<p>
 And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green
paper with a bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed. The
perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it
wasn't Christmas.
</p>
<p>
 Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case
someone had their Quieter turned down low.
</p>
<p>
 There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear
wax without a seal impressed.
</p>
<p>
 Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter
inside.
</p>
<p>
 The letter said:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell,
passed down through his descendants the Potters. Unlike lesser
cloaks and spells it has the power to keep you
  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
   hidden

  , not merely invisible.
Your father lent it to me to study shortly before he died, and I
confess that I have received much good use of it over the
years.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  In the future I shall have to get along with
Disillusionment, I fear. It is time the Cloak was returned to you,
its heir. I had thought to make this a Christmas present, but it
wished to come back to your hand before then. It seems to expect
you to have need of it. Use it well.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful
pranks, as your father committed in his day. If his full misdeeds
were known, every woman in Gryffindor would gather to desecrate his
grave. I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be MOST
careful not to reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw a chance to
possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he would never let it escape
his grasp until the day he died.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  A Very Merry Christmas to you.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The note was unsigned.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">`</p>
<p>
 "Hold on," Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were
about to leave the Ravenclaw dorm. "Sorry, there's something else
I've got to do with my trunk. I'll be along to breakfast in a
couple of minutes."
</p>
<p>
 Terry Boot scowled at Harry. "You'd better not be planning to go
through any of our things."
</p>
<p>
 Harry held up one hand. "I swear that I intend to do nothing of
the sort to any of your things, that I only intend to access
objects that I myself own, that I have no pranking or otherwise
questionable intentions towards any of you, and that I do not
anticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast in
the Great Hall."
</p>
<p>
 Terry frowned. "Wait, is that -"
</p>
<p>
 "Don't worry," said Penelope Clearwater, who was there to guide
them. "There were no loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, you should be
a lawyer."
</p>
<p>
 Harry Potter blinked at that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw
 <em>
  prefect.
 </em>
 "Thank you," he said. "I think."
</p>
<p>
 "When you try to find the Great Hall, you will get lost."
Penelope stated this in the tones of a flat, unarguable fact. "As
soon as you do, ask a portrait how to get to the first floor. Ask
another portrait the
 <em>
  instant
 </em>
 you suspect you might be lost
again.
 <em>
  Especially
 </em>
 if it seems like you're going up higher
and higher. If you are higher than the whole castle ought to be,
 <em>
  stop
 </em>
 and wait for search parties. Otherwise we shall see
you again four months later and you will be five months older and
dressed in a loincloth and covered in snow and
 <em>
  that's if you
stay inside the castle.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Understood," said Harry, swallowing hard. "Um, shouldn't you
tell students all that sort of stuff right away?"
</p>
<p>
 Penelope sighed. "What,
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 of it? That would take
weeks. You'll pick it up as you go along." She turned to go,
followed by the other students. "If I don't see you at breakfast in
thirty minutes, Potter, I'll start the search."
</p>
<p>
 Once everyone was gone, Harry attached the note to his bed -
he'd already written it and all the other notes, working in his
cavern level before everyone else woke up. Then he carefully
reached inside the Quietus field and pulled the Cloak of
Invisibility off Harry-1's still-sleeping form.
</p>
<p>
 And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into
Harry-1's pouch, knowing it would thereby already be in his
own.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 "I can see that the message is passed on to Cornelion
Flubberwalt," said the painting of a man with aristocratic airs
and, in fact, a perfectly normal nose. "But might I ask where it
came from
 <em>
  originally?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry shrugged with artful helplessness. "I was told that it was
spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within the
air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 "Hey!" Hermione said in tones of indignation from her place on
the other side of the breakfast table. "That's
 <em>
  everyone's
 </em>
 dessert! You can't just take one whole pie and put it in your
pouch!"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm not taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta
run now!" Harry ignored the cries of outrage and left the Great
Hall. He needed to arrive at Herbology class a little early.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">`</p>
<p>
 Professor Sprout eyed him sharply. "And how do
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 know
what the Slytherins are planning?"
</p>
<p>
 "I can't name my source," Harry said. "In fact I have to ask you
to pretend that this conversation never happened. Just act like you
happened across them naturally while you were on an errand, or
something. I'll run on ahead as soon as Herbology gets out. I think
I can distract the Slytherins until you get there. I'm not easy to
scare or bully, and I don't think they'll dare to seriously hurt
the Boy-Who-Lived. Though... I'm not asking you to run in the
hallways, but I would appreciate it if you didn't dawdle along the
way."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Sprout looked at him for a long moment, then her
expression softened. "Please be careful with yourself, Harry
Potter. And... thank you."
</p>
<p>
 "Just be sure not to be late," Harry said. "And remember, when
you get there, you weren't expecting to see me and this
conversation never happened."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">`</p>
<p>
 It was horrible, watching himself yank Neville out of the circle
of Slytherins. Neville had been right, he'd used too much force,
way too much force.
</p>
<p>
 "Hello," Harry Potter said coldly. "I'm the Boy-Who-Lived."
</p>
<p>
 Eight first-year boys, mostly the same height. One of them had a
scar on his forehead and he wasn't acting like the others.

 Professor McGonagall was right. The Sorting Hat was right. It
was clear once you saw it from the outside.

 There was something wrong with Harry Potter.

</p>
<p>
 Harry dipped a finger in the glass of water on his desk. It
should have been cool. But lukewarm it was, and lukewarm it had
stayed. Again.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was feeling very, very cheated.
</p>
<p>
 There were hundreds of fantasy novels scattered around the
Verres household. Harry had read quite a few. And it was starting
to look like he had a mysterious dark side. So after the glass of
water had refused to cooperate the first few times, Harry had
glanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was
watching, and then taken a deep breath, concentrated, and made
himself angry. Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and
the game where someone knocked down your books every time you tried
to pick them up again. Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said
about the ten-year-old Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really
operated...
</p>
<p>
 And the fury had entered his blood, he had held out his wand in
a hand that trembled with hate and said in cold tones
"
 <em>
  Frigideiro!
 </em>
 " and absolutely nothing had happened.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had been
 <em>
  gypped.
 </em>
 He wanted to write someone and
demand a
 <em>
  refund
 </em>
 on his dark side which clearly
 <em>
  ought
 </em>
 to have irresistible magical power but had turned
out to be
 <em>
  defective.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Frigideiro!
 </em>
 " said Hermione again from the desk next
to him. Her water was solid ice and there were white crystals
forming on the rim of her glass. She seemed to be totally intent on
her own work and not at all conscious of the other students staring
at her with hateful eyes, which was either (a) dangerously
oblivious of her or (b) a perfectly honed performance rising to the
level of fine art.
</p>
<p>
 "Oh,
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 good, Miss Granger!" squeaked Filius
Flitwick, their Charms Professor and Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny
little man with no visible signs of being a past dueling champion.
"Excellent! Stupendous!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind
Hermione. Harry would have preferred for
 <em>
  her
 </em>
 to be
rivalling
 <em>
  him,
 </em>
 of course, but he could have accepted it
the other way around.
</p>
<p>
 As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a
position for which he was companionably rivalling all the other
Muggle-raised students except Hermione. Who was all alone and
rivalless at the top, poor thing.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the
other Muggleborns and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her
wand.
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked over at Hermione. He swallowed hard. It was the
obvious role for her in the scheme of things... "Hermione?" Harry
said tentatively. "Do you have any idea what I might be doing
wrong?"
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and
something in the back of Harry's brain screamed in desperate
humiliation.
</p>
<p>
 Five minutes later, Harry's water did seem noticeably cooler
than room temperature and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats
on the head and told him to pronounce it more carefully next time
and gone off to help someone else.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping
him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that
wasn't helping his pronunciation.
</p>
<p>
 <em>

<p>
 "Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic
you will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was
no trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch.
"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
You have been warned."
</p>
<p>
 Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped
itself into a pig. A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small
yelps. The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and
then became a desk again.
</p>
<p>
 The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and
then her eyes settled on one student.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "You only received your
schoolbooks a few days ago. Have you started reading your
Transfiguration textbook?"
</p>
<p>
 "No, sorry professor," Harry said.
</p>
<p>
 "You needn't apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read
ahead you would have been told to do so." McGonagall's fingers
rapped the desk in front of her. "Mr. Potter, would you care to
guess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured into a pig, or if
it began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration? If you
had read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly. "I'd guess it'd be easier to
start with a pig, since if it started as a desk, it might not know
how to stand up."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall shook her head. "No fault to you, Mr.
Potter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 care to guess. Wrong answers will be marked with
extreme severity, questions left blank will be marked with great
leniency. You must learn to know what you do not know. If I ask you
any question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you answer
'I'm not sure', I will not hold it against you and anyone who
laughs will lose House points. Can you tell me why this rule
exists, Mr. Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly
dangerous.
 </em>
 "No."
</p>
<p>
 "Correct. Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition,
which is not taught until your sixth year. Unfortunately,
Transfiguration must be learned and practised at a young age to
maximise your adult ability. So this is a dangerous subject, and
you should be quite scared of making any mistakes, because none of
my students have ever been permanently injured and I will be
 <em>
  extremely put out
 </em>
 if you are the first class to
 <em>
  spoil
my record
 </em>
 ."
</p>
<p>
 Several students gulped.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall stood up and moved over to the wall behind
her desk, which held a white wooden board. "There are many reasons
why Transfiguration is dangerous, but one reason stands above all
the rest." She produced a marker seemingly from thin air, and
sketched letters in bright red; which she then underlined, using
the same marker, in blue:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
 <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT
PERMANENT!
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 "Transfiguration is not permanent!" said Professor McGonagall.
"Transfiguration is not permanent! Transfiguration is not
permanent! Mr. Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of
wood into a cup of water, and you drank it. What do you imagine
might happen to you when the Transfiguration wore off?" There was a
pause. "Excuse me, I should not have asked that of you, Mr. Potter,
I forgot that you are blessed with an unusually pessimistic
imagination -"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm fine," Harry said, swallowing hard. "So the first answer is
that I don't
 <em>
  know
 </em>
 ," the Professor nodded approvingly, "but
I
 <em>
  imagine
 </em>
 there might be... wood in my stomach, and in my
bloodstream, and if any of that water had gotten absorbed into my
body's tissues - would it be wood pulp or solid wood or..." Harry's
grasp of magic failed him. He couldn't understand how wood mapped
into water in the first place, so he couldn't understand what would
happen after the water molecules were scrambled by ordinary thermal
motions and the magic wore off and the mapping reversed.
</p>
<p>
 McGonagall's face was stiff. "As Mr. Potter has correctly
reasoned, he would become extremely sick and require immediate
Flooing to St. Mungo's Hospital if he was to have any chance of
survival. Please turn your textbooks to page 5."
</p>
<p>
 Even without any sound in the moving picture, you could tell
that the woman with horribly discolored skin was screaming.
</p>
<p>
 "The criminal who originally Transfigured gold into wine and
gave it to this woman to drink, 'in payment of the debt' as he put
it, received a sentence of ten years in Azkaban. Please turn to
page 6. That is a Dementor. They are the guardians of Azkaban. They
suck away at your magic, your life, and any happy thoughts you try
to have. The picture on page 7 is of the criminal ten years later,
on his release. You will note that he is dead - yes, Mr.
Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "Professor," Harry said, "if the worst happens in a case like
that, is there any way of
 <em>
  maintaining
 </em>
 the
Transfiguration?"
</p>
<p>
 "No," Professor McGonagall said flatly. "Sustaining a
Transfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales with
the size of the target form. And you would need to recontact the
target every few hours, which is, in a case like this, impossible.
Disasters like this are
 <em>
  unrecoverable!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard. "You
will absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything
into a liquid or a gas. No water, no air. Nothing like water,
nothing like air. Even if it is not meant to drink. Liquid
 <em>
  evaporates,
 </em>
 little bits and pieces of it get into the air.
You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned. It will
make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never
Transfigure anything that could conceivably go inside anyone's body
by any means. No food. Nothing that
 <em>
  looks like
 </em>
 food. Not
even as a funny little prank where you mean to tell them about your
mud pie before they actually eat it. You will never do it. Period.
Inside this classroom or out of it or
 <em>
  anywhere.
 </em>
 Is that
well understood by
 <em>
  every single student?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," said Harry, Hermione, and a few others. The rest seemed
to be speechless.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Is that well understood by every single student?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," they said or muttered or whispered.
</p>
<p>
 "If you break any of these rules you will not further study
Transfiguration during your stay at Hogwarts. Repeat along with me.
I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."
</p>
<p>
 "I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas," said
the students in ragged chorus.
</p>
<p>
 "Again! Louder! I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid
or gas."
</p>
<p>
 "I will never Transfigure anything into a liquid or gas."
</p>
<p>
 "I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or
anything else that goes inside a human body."
</p>
<p>
 "I will never Transfigure anything that is to be burned because
it could make smoke."
</p>
<p>
 "You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,
including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins
have ways of finding out who did it. As a matter of recognised law,
the goblin nation is in a permanent state of
 <em>
  war
 </em>
 with all
magical counterfeiters. They will not send Aurors. They will send
an army."
</p>
<p>
 "I will never Transfigure anything that looks like money,"
repeated the students.
</p>
<p>
 "And
 <em>
  above all
 </em>
 ," said Professor McGonagall, "you will
not Transfigure any living subject,
 <em>
  especially yourselves.
 </em>
 It will make you very sick and possibly dead, depending on how you
Transfigure yourself and how long you maintain the change."
Professor McGonagall paused. "Mr. Potter is currently holding up
his hand because he has seen an Animagus transformation -
specifically, a human transforming into a cat and back again. But
an Animagus transformation is not
 <em>
  free
 </em>
 Transfiguration."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall took a small piece of wood out of her
pocket. With a tap of her wand it became a glass ball. Then she
said "
 <em>
  Crystferrium!
 </em>
 " and the glass ball became a steel
ball. She tapped it with her wand one last time and the steel ball
became a piece of wood once more. "
 <em>
  Crystferrium
 </em>
 transforms
a subject of solid glass into a similarly shaped target of solid
steel. It cannot do the reverse, nor can it transform a desk into a
pig. The most general form of Transfiguration - free
Transfiguration, which you will be learning here - is capable of
transforming any subject into any target, at least so far as
physical form is concerned. For this reason, free Transfiguration
must be done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words
for every different transformation between subject and target."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look.
"
 <em>
  Some
 </em>
 teachers begin with Transfiguration Charms and move
on to free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, that would be much
easier in the beginning. But it can set you in a poor mold which
impairs your abilities later. Here you will learn free
Transfiguration from the
 <em>
  very start
 </em>
 , which requires that
you cast the spell wordlessly, by holding the subject form, the
target form, and the transformation within your own mind."
</p>
<p>
 "And to answer Mr. Potter's question," Professor McGonagall went
on, "it is
 <em>
  free
 </em>
 Transfiguration which you must never do to
any living subject. There are Charms and potions which can safely,
reversibly transform living subjects in
 <em>
  limited
 </em>
 ways. An
Animagus with a missing limb will still be missing that limb after
transforming, for example. Free Transfiguration is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 safe. Your body will change while it is Transfigured - breathing,
for example, results in a constant loss of the body's stuff to the
surrounding air. When the Transfiguration wears off and your body
tries to revert to its
 <em>
  original
 </em>
 form, it will not quite be
able to do so. If you press your wand to your body and imagine
yourself with golden hair, afterwards your hair will fall out. If
you visualise yourself as someone with clearer skin, you will be
taking a long stay at St. Mungo's. And if you Transfigure yourself
into an adult bodily form, then, when the Transfiguration wears
off, you will die."
</p>
<p>
 That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls
less than perfectly pretty. Or old people, for that matter. That
wouldn't happen if you could just Transfigure yourself every
morning... Harry raised his hand and tried to signal Professor
McGonagall with his eyes.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Yes
 </em>
 , Mr. Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "Is it possible to Transfigure a living subject into a target
that is static, such as a coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry,
let's just say a steel ball."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall shook her head. "Mr. Potter, even inanimate
objects undergo small internal changes over time. There would be no
visible changes to your body afterwards, and for the first minute,
you would notice nothing wrong. But in an hour you would be sick,
and in a day you would be dead."
</p>
<p>
 "Erm, excuse me, so if I'd read the first chapter I could have
 <em>
  guessed
 </em>
 that the desk was originally a desk and not a
pig," Harry said, "but only if I made the
 <em>
  further
 </em>
 assumption that you didn't want to kill the pig, that might
 <em>
  seem
 </em>
 highly probable but -"
</p>
<p>
 "I can foresee that marking your tests will be an endless source
of delight to me, Mr. Potter. But if you have other questions can I
please ask you to wait until after class?"
</p>
<p>
 "No further questions, professor."
</p>
<p>
 "Now repeat after me," said Professor McGonagall. "I will never
try to Transfigure any living subject, especially myself, unless
specifically instructed to do so using a specialised Charm or
potion."
</p>
<p>
 "If I am not sure whether a Transfiguration is safe, I will not
try it until I have asked Professor McGonagall or Professor
Flitwick or Professor Snape or the Headmaster, who are the only
recognised authorities on Transfiguration at Hogwarts. Asking
another student is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 acceptable, even if they say that
they remember asking the same question."
</p>
<p>
 "Even if the current Defence Professor at Hogwarts tells me that
a Transfiguration is safe, and even if I see the Defence Professor
do it and nothing bad seems to happen, I will not try it
myself."
</p>
<p>
 "I have the absolute right to refuse to perform any
Transfiguration about which I feel the slightest bit nervous. Since
not even the Headmaster of Hogwarts can order me to do otherwise, I
certainly will not accept any such order from the Defence
Professor, even if the Defence Professor threatens to deduct one
hundred House points and have me expelled."
</p>
<p>
 "If I break any of these rules I will not further study
Transfiguration during my time at Hogwarts."
</p>
<p>
 "We will repeat these rules at the start of every class for the
first month," said Professor McGonagall. "And now, we will begin
with matches as subjects and needles as targets... put away your
wands, thank you, by 'begin' I meant that you will begin taking
notes."
</p>
<p>
 Half an hour before the end of class, Professor McGonagall
handed out the matches.
</p>
<p>
 At the end of the class Hermione had a silvery-looking match and
the entire rest of the class, Muggleborn or otherwise, had exactly
what they'd started with.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall awarded her another point for
Ravenclaw.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 After the Transfiguration class was dismissed, Hermione came
over to Harry's desk as Harry was putting away his books into his
pouch.
</p>
<p>
 "You know," Hermione said with an innocent expression on her
face, "I earned two points for Ravenclaw today."
</p>
<p>
 "So you did," Harry said shortly.
</p>
<p>
 "But that wasn't as good as your
 <em>
  seven
 </em>
 points," she
said. "I guess I'm just not as intelligent as you."
</p>
<p>
 Harry finished feeding his homework into the pouch and turned to
Hermione with his eyes narrowed. He'd actually forgotten about
that.
</p>
<p>
 She
 <em>
  batted her eyelashes
 </em>
 at him. "We have lessons every
day, though. I wonder how long it will take you to find some more
Hufflepuffs to rescue? Today is Monday. So that gives you until
Thursday."
</p>
<p>
 The two of them stared into each other's eyes, unblinking.
</p>
<p>
 Harry spoke first. "Of course you realise this means war."
</p>
<p>
 "I didn't know we'd been at peace."
</p>
<p>
 All of the other students were now watching with fascinated
eyes. All of the other students, plus, unfortunately, Professor
McGonagall.
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, Mr. Potter," sang Professor McGonagall from the other side
of the room, "I have some good news for you. Madam Pomfrey has
approved your suggestion for preventing breakage in her Spimster
wickets, and the plan is to finish the job by the end of next week.
I'd say that deserves... let's call it ten points for
Ravenclaw."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's face was gaping in betrayal and shock. Harry imagined
his own face didn't look much different.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Professor...
 </em>
 " Harry hissed.
</p>
<p>
 "Those ten points are
 <em>
  unquestionably
 </em>
 deserved, Mr.
Potter. I would not hand out House points on a whim. To you it
might have been a simple matter of seeing something fragile and
suggesting a way to protect it, but Spimster wickets are expensive,
and the Headmaster was
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 pleased the last time one
broke." Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. "My, I wonder if
any other student has ever earned seventeen House points on his
first day of lessons. I'll have to look it up, but I suspect that's
a new record. Perhaps we should have an announcement at
dinnertime?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  PROFESSOR!
 </em>
 " Harry shrieked. "This is
 <em>
  our
 </em>
 war! Stop meddling!"
</p>
<p>
 "Now you have until Thursday of
 <em>
  next
 </em>
 week, Mr. Potter.
Unless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and
 <em>
  lose
 </em>
 House points before then. Addressing a professor
disrespectfully, for example." Professor McGonagall put a finger on
her cheek and looked reflective. "I expect you'll hit negative
numbers before the end of Friday."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's mouth snapped shut. He sent his best Death Glare at
McGonagall but she only seemed to find it amusing.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner," Professor
McGonagall mused. "But it wouldn't do to offend the Slytherins, so
the announcement should be brief. Just the number of points and the
fact of the record... and if anyone comes to you for help with
their schoolwork and is disappointed that you haven't even started
reading your textbooks, you can always refer them to Miss
Granger."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Professor!
 </em>
 " said Hermione in a rather high-pitched
voice.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall ignored her. "My, I wonder how long it will
take before Miss Granger does something deserving of a dinnertime
announcement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever it may be."
</p>
<p>
 Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned and
stormed out of the classroom. They were followed by a trail of
hypnotised Ravenclaws.
</p>
<p>
 "Um," Harry said. "Are we still on for after dinner?"
</p>
<p>
 "Of course," said Hermione. "I wouldn't want you to fall further
behind on your studying."
</p>
<p>
 "Why, thank you. And let me say that as brilliant as you are
already, I can't help but wonder what you'll be like once you have
some elementary training in rationality."
</p>
<p>
 "Is it really that useful? It didn't seem to help you with
Charms or Transfiguration."
</p>
<p>
 There was a slight pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago. That's why I had
to earn those seventeen House points without using my wand."
</p>
<p>
 "Four days ago? Maybe you can't read eight books in four days
but you might have at least read
 <em>
  one
 </em>
 . How many days will
it take to finish at that rate? You know all that mathematics, so
can you tell me what's eight, times four, divided by zero?"
</p>
<p>
 "I've got classes now, which you didn't, but weekends are free,
so... limit of eight times four divided by epsilon as epsilon
approaches zero plus... 10:47AM on Sunday."
</p>
<p>
 "I did it in
 <em>
  three
 </em>
 days actually."
</p>
<p>
 "2:47PM on Saturday it is, then. I'm sure I'll find the time
somewhere."
</p>
<p>
 And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

<p>
 As soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday,
Harry knew that
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 subject was going to be
 <em>
  different
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at
Hogwarts, akin to a major university classroom, with layered tiers
of desks facing a gigantic flat stage of white marble. The
classroom was high up in the castle - on the fifth floor - and
Harry knew that was as much explanation as he'd get for where a
room like this was supposed to fit. It was becoming clear that
Hogwarts simply did not
 <em>
  have
 </em>
 a geometry, Euclidean or
otherwise; it had connections, not directions.
</p>
<p>
 Unlike a university hall, there weren't rows of folding seats;
instead there were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden
chairs, lined up in a curve across each level of the classroom.
Except that each desk had a flat, white, rectangular, mysterious
object propped up on it.
</p>
<p>
 In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais
of darker marble, was a lone teacher's desk. At which Quirrell sat
slumped over in his chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly over
his robes.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Now what does that remind me of...?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students
were there yet. (The English language was defective when it came to
describing time travel; in particular, English lacked any words
capable of expressing how convenient it was.) Quirrell didn't seem
to be... functional... at the moment, and Harry didn't particularly
feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.
</p>
<p>
 Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved
the Defence textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way
through - he'd planned on finishing the book before this lesson,
actually, but he was running behind schedule and had already used
the Time-Turner twice today.
</p>
<p>
 Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry
ignored them.
</p>
<p>
 "Potter? What are
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 doing here?"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  That
 </em>
 voice didn't belong here. Harry looked up. "Draco?
What are
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 doing in oh my god you have
 <em>
  minions
 </em>
 ."
</p>
<p>
 One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a
lot of muscle for an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a
suspiciously balanced-looking stance.
</p>
<p>
 The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured
behind him. "Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe," his hand moved
from Muscles to Balance, "Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is
Harry Potter."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was
probably supposed to mean something but ended up just looking
squinty. Mr. Crabbe said "Please to meetcha" in a tone that sounded
like he was trying to lower his voice as far as it could go.
</p>
<p>
 A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco's face, but
was quickly replaced by his superior grin.
</p>
<p>
 "You have
 <em>
  minions!
 </em>
 " Harry repeated. "Where do
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 get minions?"
</p>
<p>
 Draco's smirk grew wider. "I'm afraid, Potter, that the first
step is to be Sorted into Slytherin -"
</p>
<p>
 "What? That's not fair!"
</p>
<p>
 "- and then for your families to have an arrangement from before
you were born."
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to be
trying very hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards,
hunching over their shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring
at him.
</p>
<p>
 "Um... hold on," said Harry. "This was arranged
 <em>
  years
 </em>
 ago?"
</p>
<p>
 "Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid you're out of luck."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth,
still looming.
</p>
<p>
 "And," said Harry, "Lucius insisted that you were
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 to grow up knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet
them on your first day of school."
</p>
<p>
 That wiped the grin from Draco's face. "Yes, Potter, we all know
you're brilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop
showing off -"
</p>
<p>
 "So they've been told their
 <em>
  whole lives
 </em>
 that they're
going to be your minions and they've spent
 <em>
  years
 </em>
 imagining
what minions are supposed to be like -"
</p>
<p>
 Draco winced.
</p>
<p>
 "- and what's worse, they
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 know
 <em>
  each other
 </em>
 and they've been
 <em>
  practising
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 "The boss told ya to shut it," rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit
down on his toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one
hand to crack the knuckles on the other.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "I told you not to do this in front of Harry
Potter!"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the
toothpick back in a pocket of his robes.
</p>
<p>
 But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again,
they went back to looming.
</p>
<p>
 "I apologise," Draco said stiffly, "for the insult which these
 <em>
  imbeciles
 </em>
 have offered you."
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. "I'd
say you're being a little harsh on them, Draco.
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 think
they're acting exactly the way I'd want
 <em>
  my
 </em>
 minions to act.
I mean, if I had any minions."
</p>
<p>
 Draco's jaw dropped.
</p>
<p>
 "Hey, Gregory, you don' think he's tryna lure us away from the
boss, do ya?"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sure Mr. Potter wouldn't be that foolish."
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, I wouldn't dream of it," Harry said smoothly. "It's just
something to keep in mind if your current employer seems
unappreciative. Besides, it never hurts to have other offers while
you're negotiating your working conditions, right?"
</p>
<p>
 "What's
 <em>
  he
 </em>
 doin' in Ravenclaw?"
</p>
<p>
 "I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe."
</p>
<p>
 "Both of you
 <em>
  shut up
 </em>
 ," Draco said through gritted
teeth. "That's an
 <em>
  order
 </em>
 ." With a visible effort, he
transferred his attention to Harry again. "Anyway, what're you
doing in the Slytherin Defence class?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry frowned. "Hold on." His hand went into his pouch.
"Timetable." He looked over the parchment. "Defence, 2:30pm, and
right now it's..." Harry looked at his mechanical watch, which read
11:23. "2:23, unless I've lost track of time. Did I?" If he had,
well, Harry knew how to get to whatever lesson he was
 <em>
  supposed
 </em>
 to be at. God he loved his Time-Turner and
someday, when he was old enough, they would get married.
</p>
<p>
 "No, that sounds right," Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze
turned to look over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling
with green-trimmed robes and...
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Gryffindorks!
 </em>
 " spat Draco. "What're
 <em>
  they
 </em>
 doing here?"
</p>
<p>
 "Hm," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell did say... I forget his
exact words... that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts
teaching conventions. Maybe he just combined all his classes."
</p>
<p>
 "Huh," said Draco. "You're the first Ravenclaw in here."
</p>
<p>
 "Yup. Got here early."
</p>
<p>
 "What're you doing all the way in the back row, then?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked. "I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?"
</p>
<p>
 Draco made a scoffing sound. "You couldn't get any further away
from the teacher if you tried." The blonde-haired boy leaned
slightly closer. "Anyway, is it true about what you said to Derrick
and his crew?"
</p>
<p>
 "Who's Derrick?"
</p>
<p>
 "You hit him with a pie?"
</p>
<p>
 "Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to
him?"
</p>
<p>
 "That he wasn't doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was a
disgrace to Salazar Slytherin." Draco was staring intently at
Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "That... sounds about right," Harry said. "I think it was more
like, 'is this some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain
you a future advantage or is it really as much of a disgrace to the
memory of Salazar Slytherin as it looks like' or something like
that. I don't remember the exact words."
</p>
<p>
 "You're confusing everyone, you know," said the blonde-haired
boy.
</p>
<p>
 "Huh?" Harry said in honest confusion.
</p>
<p>
 "Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hat
is one of the warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was
talking about it, wondering if they should start sucking up to you
just in case. Then you went and protected a bunch of
 <em>
  Hufflepuffs,
 </em>
 for Merlin's sake.
 <em>
  Then
 </em>
 you told
Derrick he's a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's
anyone
 <em>
  supposed
 </em>
 to think?"
</p>
<p>
 "That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of
'Slytherin! Just kidding! Ravenclaw!' and I've been acting
accordingly."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to
quickly clap a hand to his mouth.
</p>
<p>
 "We'd better go get our seats," Draco said. He hesitated,
straightened a bit, spoke a bit more fomally. "But I do want to
continue our last conversation and I accept your conditions."
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded. "Would you mind terribly if I waited until
Saturday afternoon? I'm in a bit of a contest right now."
</p>
<p>
 "A contest?"
</p>
<p>
 "See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger
did."
</p>
<p>
 "Granger," Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. "The mudblood who
thinks she's Merlin? If you're trying to show
 <em>
  her
 </em>
 up then
all Slytherin wishes you the
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 best luck, Potter, and I
won't bother you 'til Saturday." Draco inclined his head
respectfully, and wandered off, tailed by his minions.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Oh, this is going to be
 </em>
 so
 <em>
  much fun to juggle, I
can already tell.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of
trim: green, red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends
seemed to be in the midst of trying to acquire three contiguous
front-row seats - already occupied, of course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr.
Goyle were looming vigorously, but it didn't seem to be having much
effect.
</p>
<p>
 Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 At 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else
seemed to be coming in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in
his chair and sat up straight, and his face appeared on all the
flat, white rectangular objects that were propped up on the
students' desks.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of
Professor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle
television. There was something both nostalgic and sad about that,
it seemed so much like a piece of home and yet it wasn't
really...
</p>
<p>
 "Good afternoon, my young apprentices," said Professor Quirrell.
His voice seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking
directly to Harry. "Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic,
as the founders of Hogwarts would have put it; or, as it happens to
be called in the late twentieth century, Defence Against the Dark
Arts."
</p>
<p>
 There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students,
taken by surprise, reached for their parchment or notebooks.
</p>
<p>
 "No," Professor Quirrell said. "Don't bother writing down what
this subject was once called. No such pointless question will count
toward your marks in any of my lessons. That is a promise."
</p>
<p>
 Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather
shocked.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. "Those of you who have
wasted time by reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks
-"
</p>
<p>
 Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was
Hermione.
</p>
<p>
 "- may have gotten the impression that although this subject is
called Defence Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to
defend against Nightmare Butterflies, which cause mildly bad
dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve all the way through a
two-inch wooden beam given most of a day."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the
desk. The screen on Harry's desk followed his every move. Professor
Quirrell strode towards the front of the classroom, and
bellowed:
</p>
<p>
 "The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes
fire so quickly and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in
midflight! One Killing Curse will bring it down!"
</p>
<p>
 There were gasps from the students.
</p>
<p>
 "The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian
Horntail! It is strong enough to bite through steel! Its hide is
resistant enough to withstand Stunning Hexes and Cutting Charms!
Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from afar whether
its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome
of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously
maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is always
transforming into its own body. If you somehow succeed in ripping
off its arm it will grow another within seconds! Fire and acid will
produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a troll's
regenerative powers - for an hour or two! They are smart enough to
use clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect
killing machine in all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it
down."
</p>
<p>
 The students were looking rather shocked.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. "Your sad excuse
for a third-year Defence textbook will suggest to you that you
expose the mountain troll to sunlight, which will freeze it in
place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort of useless knowledge
you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter mountain
trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to
stop them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show
off their mastery of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just
because there is a ridiculously obscure way of dealing with
mountain trolls does not mean you should actually try to use it!
The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every
single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you
find yourself incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can
simply Apparate away! Likewise if you are facing the second most
perfect killing machine, a Dementor. You just Apparate away!"
</p>
<p>
 "Unless, of course," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now
lower and harder, "you are under the influence of an
anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly one monster which can
threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most dangerous
monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes
close. The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be
able to threaten you."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's lips were set in a thin line. "I will
reluctantly teach you enough trivia for a passing mark on the
Ministry-mandated portions of your first-year finals. Since your
exact mark on these sections will make no difference to your future
life, anyone who wants more than a passing mark is welcome to waste
their own time studying our pathetic excuse for a textbook. The
title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are
here to learn how to defend yourselves against the Dark Arts. Which
means, let us be very clear on this, defending yourselves against
Dark Wizards. People with wands who want to hurt you and who will
likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them first! There is no
defence without offence! There is no defence without fighting! This
reality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat,
overpaid, Auror-guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum.
To the abyss with those fools! You are here for the subject that
has been taught at Hogwarts for eight hundred years! Welcome to
your first year of Battle Magic!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry started applauding. He couldn't help himself, it was too
inspiring.
</p>
<p>
 Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response
from Gryffindor, and more from Slytherin, but most students simply
seemed too stunned to react.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died
instantly. "Thank you very much," said Professor Quirrell. "Now to
practicalities. I have combined all my first-year Battle classes
into one, which allows me to offer you twice as much classroom time
as Doubles sessions -"
</p>
<p>
 There were gasps of horror.
</p>
<p>
 "- an increased load which I will make up to you by not
assigning any homework."
</p>
<p>
 The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to
write twelve inches on fighting due Monday."
</p>
<p>
 Harry desperately wished he'd sat next to Hermione so he could
see the look on her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty
sure he was imagining it accurately.
</p>
<p>
 Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him,
the Time-Turner, and Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 "For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some
after-school activities that I think you will find quite
interesting as well as educational. Do you want to show the world
your
 <em>
  own
 </em>
 abilities instead of watching fourteen other
people play Quidditch? More than seven people can fight in an
army."
</p>
<p>
 Hot
 <em>
  damn.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "These and other after-school activities will also earn you
Quirrell points. What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point
system does not suit my needs, because it makes House points too
rare. I prefer to let my students know how they are doing more
frequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer you a
written test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get
too many related questions wrong, your test will show the names of
students who got those questions right, and those students will be
able to earn Quirrell points by helping you."
</p>
<p>
 ...wow. Why didn't the other professors use a system like
that?
</p>
<p>
 "What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten
Quirrell points will be worth one House point. But they will earn
you other favors as well. Would you like to take your exam at an
unusual time? Is there a particular session you would very much
prefer to skip? You will find that I can be very flexible on behalf
of students who have accumulated enough Quirrell points. Quirrell
points will control the generalship of the armies. And for
Christmas - just before the Christmas break - I will grant someone
a wish. Any school-related feat that lies within my power, my
influence, or above all, my ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and
I am offering to formulate a cunning plot on your behalf, if that
is what it takes to accomplish your desire. This wish will go to
whoever has earned the most Quirrell points within all seven
years."
</p>
<p>
 That would be Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "Now leave your books and loose items at your desks - they will
be safe, the screens will watch over them for you - and come down
onto this platform. It's time to play a game called Who's the Most
Dangerous Student in the Classroom."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said
"
 <em>
  Ma-ha-su!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was another high-pitched "bing" from the floating blue
sphere that Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target.
That particular sound meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been
gotten on nine out of his last ten attempts.
</p>
<p>
 Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was
incredibly easy to pronounce,
 <em>
  and
 </em>
 had a ridiculously
simple wand motion,
 <em>
  and
 </em>
 had a tendency to hit wherever you
were currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had disdainfully
proclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this.
That the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. That it was a
barely ordered burst of magic whose only real content was the
aiming, and that it would produce, when it hit, a pain briefly
equivalent to being punched hard in the nose. That the sole purpose
of this test was to see who was a fast learner, since Professor
Quirrell was certain no one would have previously encountered this
hex or anything like it.
</p>
<p>
 Harry didn't care about any of that.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Ma-ha-su!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 A
 <em>
  red bolt of energy
 </em>
 shot out of his wand and struck
the target and the blue sphere once again made the bing which meant
the spell had
 <em>
  actually worked for him.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since
he'd come to Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the
little spheres that Ben Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for
some reason Professor Quirrell had instead lined up all the
students and targets in neat orders which made sure they wouldn't
fire on each other.
</p>
<p>
 So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his
wand and twisted and shouted "
 <em>
  Ma-ha-su!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was a lower-pitched "dong" which meant he'd gotten it
almost right.
</p>
<p>
 Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and
drew and fired another red bolt of energy.
</p>
<p>
 The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most
satisfying sounds he'd heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in
triumph at the top of his lungs.
 <em>
  I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS
OF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE YOU!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Ma-ha-su!
 </em>
 " Harry's voice was loud, but hardly
noticeable over the steady chant of similar cries from around the
classroom platform.
</p>
<p>
 "Enough," said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It didn't
sound loud. It sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind
your left shoulder, no matter where you were standing relative to
Professor Quirrell.) "I see that all of you have succeeded at least
once now." The target-spheres turned red and began to drift up
towards the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center
of the platform, leaning slightly on his teacher's desk with one
hand.
</p>
<p>
 "I told you," Professor Quirrell said, "that we would play a
game called Who's the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom.
There is one student in this classroom who mastered the Sumerian
Simple Strike Hex faster than anyone else -"
</p>
<p>
 Oh blah blah blah.
</p>
<p>
 "- and went on to help seven other students. For which she has
earned the first seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come
forth, Hermione Granger. It is time for the next stage of the
game."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of
triumph and apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on
proudly, the Slytherins with glares, and Harry with frank
annoyance. Harry had done fine this time. He was probably even in
the upper half of the class, now that everyone had been faced with
an equally unfamiliar spell and Harry had read all the way through
Adalbert Waffling's
 <em>
  Magical Theory
 </em>
 . And yet
 <em>
  Hermione
was still doing better
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione was
simply smarter than him.
</p>
<p>
 But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts
that (a) Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks
and (b) Adalbert Waffling was an uninspired sod who'd written
 <em>
  Magical Theory
 </em>
 to pander to a school board that didn't
think much of eleven-year-olds.
</p>
<p>
 Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.
</p>
<p>
 "Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in two
minutes, almost a full minute faster than the next runner-up."
Professor Quirrell turned slowly in place to look at all the
students watching them. "Could Miss Granger's intelligence make her
the most dangerous student in the classroom? Well? What do you
think?"
</p>
<p>
 No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harry
wasn't sure what to say.
</p>
<p>
 "Let's find out, shall we?" said Professor Quirrell. He turned
back to Hermione, and gestured toward the wider class. "Select any
student you like and cast the Simple Strike Hex on them."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione froze where she stood.
</p>
<p>
 "Come now," Professor Quirrell said smoothly. "You have cast
this spell perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently
harmful or even all that painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch
and lasts only a few seconds." Professor Quirrell's voice grew
harder. "This is a direct order from your professor, Miss Granger.
Choose a target and fire a Simple Strike Hex."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's face was screwed up in horror and her wand was
trembling in her hand. Harry's own fingers were clenching his own
wand hard in sympathy. Even though he could see what Professor
Quirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the point
Professor Quirrell was trying to make.
</p>
<p>
 "If you do
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger,
you will lose a Quirrell point."
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction.
His right hand was softly tapping his own chest.
 <em>
  Pick me, I'm
not afraid...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, and
she lowered her wand to her side.
</p>
<p>
 "No," said Hermione Granger.
</p>
<p>
 Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn't loud, everyone
heard it in the silence.
</p>
<p>
 "Then I must deduct one point from you," said Professor
Quirrell. "This is a test, and you have failed it."
</p>
<p>
 That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shoulders
straight.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill
the whole room. "Knowing things isn't always enough, Miss Granger.
If you cannot give and receive violence on the order of stubbing
your toe, then you cannot defend yourself and you will not pass
Defence. Please rejoin your classmates."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her face
looked peaceful and Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start
clapping. Even though Professor Quirrell had been
 <em>
  right
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 "So," Professor Quirrell said. "It becomes clear that Hermione
Granger is not the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do
you think might actually be the most dangerous person here? -
besides me, of course."
</p>
<p>
 Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin
contingent.
</p>
<p>
 "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell. "It seems that many of your fellow pupils are
looking in your direction. Come forth, if you would."
</p>
<p>
 Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He
stepped onto the dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a
smile.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Malfoy," Professor Quirrell said. "Fire."
</p>
<p>
 Harry would have tried to stop it if there'd been time but in
one smooth motion Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised
his wand and said "
 <em>
  Mahasu!
 </em>
 " like it was all one syllable
and Hermione was saying "Ow!" and that was that.
</p>
<p>
 "Well struck," said Professor Quirrell. "Two Quirrell points to
you. But tell me, why did you target Miss Granger?"
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause.
</p>
<p>
 Finally Draco said, "Because she stood out the most."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's lips turned up in a thin smile. "And that
is the true reason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected
any other, that child would more likely resent being singled out,
and Mr. Malfoy would more probably make an enemy. And while Mr.
Malfoy might have given some other justification for selecting her,
that would have served him no purpose save to alienate some of you,
while others are already cheering him whether he says anything or
not. Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy is dangerous because he knows
who to strike and who not to strike, how to make allies and avoid
making enemies. Two more Quirrell points to you, Mr. Malfoy. And as
you have demonstrated an exemplary virtue of Slytherin, I think
that Salazar's House has earned a point as well. You may rejoin
your friends."
</p>
<p>
 Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin
contingent. Some clapping started from the green-trimmed robes, but
Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture and silence fell
again.
</p>
<p>
 "It might seem that our game is done," said Professor Quirrell.
"And yet there is a single student in this classroom who is more
dangerous than the scion of Malfoy."
</p>
<p>
 And
 <em>
  now
 </em>
 for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot
of people looking at...
</p>
<p>
 "Harry Potter. Come forth."
</p>
<p>
 This did not bode well.
</p>
<p>
 Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood
on his raised dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher's
desk.
</p>
<p>
 The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be
sharpening Harry's wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was
ruffling through possibilities for what Professor Quirrell might
think could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness. Would he be asked to
cast a spell? To defeat a Dark Lord?
</p>
<p>
 Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely
Professor Quirrell was too smart for
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 ...
</p>
<p>
 Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell
didn't ask him to come any closer.
</p>
<p>
 "The irony is," said Professor Quirrell, "you all looked at the
right person for entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking,"
Professor Quirrell's lips twisted, "that Harry Potter has defeated
the Dark Lord, and so must be very dangerous. Bah. He was one year
old. Whatever quirk of fate killed the Dark Lord likely had little
to do with Mr. Potter's abilities as a fighter. But after I heard
rumors of one Ravenclaw facing down five older Slytherins, I
interviewed several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that
Harry Potter would be my most dangerous student."
</p>
<p>
 A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry's system, making him
stand up straighter. He didn't know what conclusion Professor
Quirrell had come to, but that couldn't be good.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah, Professor Quirrell -" Harry started to say.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell looked amused. "You're thinking that I've
come up with a wrong answer, aren't you, Mr. Potter? You will learn
to expect better of
 <em>
  me
 </em>
 ." Professor Quirrell straightened
from where he had leaned on the desk. "Mr. Potter, all things have
their accustomed uses. Give me ten unaccustomed uses of objects in
this room for combat!"
</p>
<p>
 For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw
shock of having been understood.
</p>
<p>
 And then the ideas started to pour out.
</p>
<p>
 "There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped
from a great height. There are chairs with metal legs that could
impale someone if driven hard enough. The air in this classroom
would be deadly by its absence, since people die in vacuum, and it
can serve as a carrier for poison gases."
</p>
<p>
 Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause
Professor Quirrell said:
</p>
<p>
 "That's three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that
you've already used up the whole contents of the classroom."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Ha!
 </em>
 The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to
fall into, the ceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can
serve as raw material for Transfiguration into any number of deadly
things - knives, say."
</p>
<p>
 "That's six. But surely you're scraping the bottom of the barrel
now?"
</p>
<p>
 "I haven't even started! Just look at all the people! Having a
Gryffindor attack the enemy is an
 <em>
  ordinary
 </em>
 use, of course
-"
</p>
<p>
 "I will not count that one."
</p>
<p>
 "- but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclaws
are known for their brains, but their internal organs could be sold
on the black market for enough money to hire an assassin.
Slytherins aren't just useful as assassins, they can also be thrown
at sufficient velocity to crush an enemy. And Hufflepuffs, in
addition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be
removed, sharpened, and used to stab someone."
</p>
<p>
 By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some
horror. Even the Slytherins looked shocked.
</p>
<p>
 "That's ten, though I'm being generous in counting the Ravenclaw
one. Now, for extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of
objects in this room which you have not yet named." Professor
Quirrell favored Harry with a companionable smile. "The rest of
your class thinks you are in trouble now, since you've named
everything except the targets and you have no idea what may be done
with those."
</p>
<p>
 "Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be
used to suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough
times, or Hermione Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips
and tied into a rope and used to hang someone, or Draco Malfoy's
robes, which can be used to start a fire -"
</p>
<p>
 "Three points," said Professor Quirrell, "no more clothing
now."
</p>
<p>
 "My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye
socket" and someone made a horrified, strangling sound.
</p>
<p>
 "Four points, no more wands."
</p>
<p>
 "My wristwatch could suffocate someone if jammed down their
throat -"
</p>
<p>
 "Five points, and enough."
</p>
<p>
 "Hmph," Harry said. "Ten Quirrell points to one House point,
right? You should have let me keep going until I'd won the House
Cup, I haven't even started yet on the unaccustomed uses of
everything I've got in my pockets" or the mokeskin pouch itself and
he couldn't talk about the Time-Turner or the invisibility cloak
but there had to be
 <em>
  something
 </em>
 he could say about those red
spheres...
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Enough,
 </em>
 Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you
understand what makes Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the
classroom?"
</p>
<p>
 There was a low murmur of assent.
</p>
<p>
 "Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate
dangerous?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah... um... he's creative?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Wrong!
 </em>
 " bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist
came down sharply on his desk with an amplified sound that made
everyone jump. "All of Mr. Potter's ideas were worse than
useless!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry started in surprise.
</p>
<p>
 "Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat
you do not have that sort of preparation time and if you did there
would be a hundred better uses! Transfigure material from the
walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had
exactly one idea which he could use immediately, right now, without
extensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does not
know. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket.
Which would be more likely to break his wand than kill his
opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were
uniformly awful."
</p>
<p>
 "What?" Harry said indignantly. "You
 <em>
  asked
 </em>
 for unusual
ideas, not practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How
would
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 use something in this classroom to kill
someone?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were
smile crinkles around his eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said you were
to
 <em>
  kill.
 </em>
 There is a time and a place for taking your enemy
alive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is usually one of those
places. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck with the
edge of a chair."
</p>
<p>
 There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were
laughing with Harry, not at him.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone else was looking rather horrified.
</p>
<p>
 "But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most
dangerous student in the classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses
of items in this room for combat. Mr. Potter could have suggested
using a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to trip an oncoming
enemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised
shield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was
offensive rather than defensive, and either fatal or potentially
fatal."
</p>
<p>
 What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of
vertigo as he tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely
there had to be a counterexample...
</p>
<p>
 "And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is why Mr. Potter's ideas
were so strange and useless - because he had to reach far into the
impractical in order to meet his standard of
 <em>
  killing the
enemy.
 </em>
 To him, any idea which fell short of that was not worth
considering. This reflects a quality that we might call
 <em>
  intent
to kill
 </em>
 . I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could
stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it,
not yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary
murder, but even he was shocked - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was
watching your face - when Mr. Potter described how to use his
classmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your
mind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter
thinks
 <em>
  purely
 </em>
 of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any
means to do so, he does not flinch, his censors are off. Even
though his youthful genius is so undisciplined and impractical as
to be useless, his
 <em>
  intent to kill
 </em>
 makes Harry Potter the
Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. One final point to him -
no, let us make that a point to Ravenclaw - for this indispensable
requisite of a true fighting wizard."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched
frantically for something to say to this.
 <em>
  That is so completely
not what I am about!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 But he could see that the other students were starting to
believe it. Harry's mind was flipping through possible denials and
not finding anything that could stand up against the authoritative
voice of Professor Quirrell. The best Harry had come up with was
"I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative" and that sounded
kind of ominous. He needed to say something unexpected, something
that would make people stop and reconsider -
</p>
<p>
 "And now," Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter. Fire."
</p>
<p>
 Nothing happened, of course.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah, well," said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. "I suppose we
must all start somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please
for a Simple Strike Hex. You
 <em>
  will
 </em>
 do so before I dismiss
your class for the day. If you do not, I will begin deducting House
points, and I will keep on deducting them until you do."
</p>
<p>
 Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or
Professor Quirrell might start deducting House points right
away.
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face
the Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry's eyes met Draco's.
</p>
<p>
 Draco Malfoy didn't look the slightest bit afraid. The
blonde-haired boy wasn't giving any visible sign of assent such as
Harry had given Hermione, but then he could hardly be expected to
do so. The other Slytherins would think that rather odd.
</p>
<p>
 "Why the hesitation?" said Professor Quirrell. "Surely there's
only one obvious choice."
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said. "Only one
 <em>
  obvious
 </em>
 choice."
</p>
<p>
 Harry twisted the wand and said "
 <em>
  Ma-ha-su!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was complete silence in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
 Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering
sting.
</p>
<p>
 There was more silence.
</p>
<p>
 Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "Yes, quite ingenious, but
there was a lesson to be taught and you dodged it. One point from
Ravenclaw for showing off your own cleverness at the expense of the
actual goal. Class dismissed."
</p>
<p>
 And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:
</p>
<p>
 "Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"
</p>
<p>
 There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of
people thinking, and then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a
roar of conversation.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed
to talk -
</p>
<p>
 Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his
chair.
</p>
<p>
 No. Not acceptable. They
 <em>
  really
 </em>
 needed to talk. Stuff
the zombie act, Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry
poked him a couple of times. Harry started forward -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  WRONG
  <br/>
  DON'T
  <br/>
  BAD IDEA
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.
</p>
<p>
 And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the
discussions began.

<p>
 Thursday.
</p>
<p>
 If you wanted to be specific, 7:24am on Thursday morning.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his
motionless hands.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had just had an idea for a
 <em>
  truly brilliant
 </em>
 experimental test.
</p>
<p>
 It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was
why he had cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to
be tested right away, immediately, now.
</p>
<p>
 Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his
bed, yanked out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs,
and started moving boxes of books around. (He really needed to
unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was in the middle of
his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling behind so he
hadn't had time.)
</p>
<p>
 Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.
</p>
<p>
 The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the
Great Hall and start the day.
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me can you do something for me?" said Harry. He was
flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with
the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the
book at Anthony Goldstein. "Pick two three-digit numbers from this
list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them together and
tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to
double-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer,
I'm not sure what's going to happen to me or the universe if you
make a multiplication error."
</p>
<p>
 It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over
the past few days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything
like "Why'd you suddenly flip out?" or "That seems really weird,
what are your reasons for asking?" or "What do you mean, you're not
sure what's going to happen to the universe?"
</p>
<p>
 Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment
and quill. Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to
see anything, dancing back and forth and bouncing up and down with
impatience. He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got
ready to write.
</p>
<p>
 "Okay," Anthony said, "One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four
hundred and twenty-nine."
</p>
<p>
 Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written
down, and Anthony confirmed it.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk,
glanced at his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and
then shut his eyes.
</p>
<p>
 Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps,
followed by the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding
shut. (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating. An automatic
Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were willing
to buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have
to worry about electric bills.)
</p>
<p>
 And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been
hoping to see, a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift
of his future self.
</p>
<p>
 Call that piece of paper "Paper-2".
</p>
<p>
 Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.
</p>
<p>
 Call that "Paper-1". It was, of course, the same piece of paper.
You could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges
matched.
</p>
<p>
 Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would
follow.
</p>
<p>
 If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write
"101 x 101" down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back
in time, drop off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and
head on up out of the cavern level to join his dorm mates for
breakfast.
</p>
<p>
 If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it,
Harry would multiply those numbers together.
</p>
<p>
 If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those
two numbers on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.
</p>
<p>
 Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write
down the new pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the
number on the right greater than 997, in which case Harry would add
2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right.
</p>
<p>
 And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1
blank.
</p>
<p>
 Which meant that the only possible
 <em>
  stable
 </em>
 time loop was
the one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors of
181,429.
</p>
<p>
 If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer
that was easy to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have
 <em>
  just
 </em>
 shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this
trick was
 <em>
  more general
 </em>
 than that. Harry could use it to
find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of every
sort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of
Secrets, if Harry could figure out some systematic way of
describing all the locations in Hogwarts. It would be an awesome
cheat even by Harry's standards of cheating.
</p>
<p>
 Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.
</p>
<p>
 Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:
</p>
<p>
 DO NOT MESS WITH TIME
</p>
<p>
 Harry wrote down "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" on Paper-1 in slightly
shaky handwriting, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any
more truly brilliant experiments on Time until he was at least
fifteen years old.
</p>
<p>
 To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest
experimental result in the entire history of science.
</p>
<p>
 It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his
textbook for the next hour.
</p>
<p>
 That was how Harry's Thursday started.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 Thursday.
</p>
<p>
 If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
 Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a
grassy field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply
of broomsticks. The girls would be learning to fly separately.
Apparently, for some reason, girls didn't want to learn how to fly
on broomsticks in the presence of boys.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn't
seem to stop wondering how that
 <em>
  particular
 </em>
 stable time
loop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather
large space of possibilities.
</p>
<p>
 Also: seriously,
 <em>
  broomsticks?
 </em>
 He was going to fly on,
basically, a line segment? Wasn't that pretty much the single most
unstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting to hold
on to a point marble? Who'd selected
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 design for a
flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been hoping
that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing in
front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen
broomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of
broomsticks and failed to consider anything else? It had to be.
There was no way that the
 <em>
  optimal
 </em>
 designs for cleaning
kitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you worked them out
from scratch.
</p>
<p>
 It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun
that was just begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to
see, if you were trying to fly around the sky. The ground was nice
and dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt very, very
hard under Harry's shoes.
</p>
<p>
 Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator
of eleven-year-olds was expected to learn this and it couldn't be
that hard.
</p>
<p>
 "Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if
you're left-handed," called Madam Hooch. "And say, UP!"
</p>
<p>
 "UP!" everyone shouted.
</p>
<p>
 The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry's hand.
</p>
<p>
 Which put him at the head of the class, for once. Apparently
saying "UP!" was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most of
the broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch
away from their would-be riders.
</p>
<p>
 (Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at
least as well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day.
There couldn't possibly be anything
 <em>
  he
 </em>
 could master on the
first try which would baffle Hermione, and if there
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 and it turned out to be
 <em>
  broomstick riding
 </em>
 instead of
anything intellectual, Harry would just die.)
</p>
<p>
 It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of
them. Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around
the field, correcting grips and stances. Apparently even among the
few children who'd been allowed to fly at home, they hadn't been
taught to do it correctly.
</p>
<p>
 Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded. "Now, when I
blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard."
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his
stomach.
</p>
<p>
 "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
straight back down by leaning forwards slightly. On my whistle -
three - two -"
</p>
<p>
 One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy's
screams - of horror, not delight. The boy was spinning at an awful
rate as he ascended, they only got glimpses of his white face -
</p>
<p>
 As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own
broomstick and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn't really
know what he planned to do with it, he'd had exactly two sessions
of Charms and the last one
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been the Hover Charm but
Harry had only been able to cast the spell successfully one time
out of three and he certainly couldn't levitate whole people -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  If there is any hidden power in me, let it reveal itself
NOW!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Come back, boy!" shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most
unhelpful instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control
broomstick, from a
 <em>
  flying instructor
 </em>
 , and a fully
automatic section of Harry's brain added Madam Hooch to his tally
of fools).
</p>
<p>
 And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.
</p>
<p>
 He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Wingardium Leviosa!
 </em>
 " screamed Harry.
</p>
<p>
 The spell failed. He could feel it fail.
</p>
<p>
 There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay
facedown on the grass in a heap.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He
arrived at the boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and
Harry reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was
the name never mind he'd just try "Healer's Pack!" and it popped up
into his hand and -
</p>
<p>
 "Broken wrist," Madam Hooch said. "Calm down, boy, he just has a
broken wrist!"
</p>
<p>
 There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry's mind snapped out of
Panic Mode.
</p>
<p>
 The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and
there was a syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would
have kept the boy's brain oxygenated if he'd managed to snap his
neck.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice. His heart
was pounding so loudly that he almost couldn't hear himself panting
for breath. "Broken bone... right... Setting String?"
</p>
<p>
 "That's for emergencies only," snapped Madam Hooch. "Put it
away, he's fine." She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand.
"Come on, boy, it's all right, up you get!"
</p>
<p>
 "You're not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick
again?" Harry said in horror.
</p>
<p>
 Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. "Of course not!" She pulled the
boy to his feet using his good arm - Harry saw with a shock that it
was Neville Longbottom
 <em>
  again,
 </em>
 what was
 <em>
  with
 </em>
 him?
- and she turned to all the watching children. "None of you is to
move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those
brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can
say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
</p>
<p>
 And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his
wrist and trying to control his sniffles.
</p>
<p>
 When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started
giggling.
</p>
<p>
 That set off the others.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned and looked at them. It seemed like a good time to
memorise some faces.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied
by Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn't smiling. Mr. Goyle
decidedly was. Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face
that twitched occasionally, from which Harry inferred that Draco
thought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to be
gained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin
dungeons afterwards.
</p>
<p>
 "Well, Potter," Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry,
still with that very controlled face that was twitching
occasionally, "Just wanted to say, when you take advantage of
emergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look like you're
in total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a
complete panic." Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling
look. "But you probably scored a few points anyway. You need any
help stowing that healer's kit?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face
turned away from Draco. "I think I'm fine," Harry said. He put the
syringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.
</p>
<p>
 Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back
into his mokeskin pouch.
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff," Ernie
Macmillan said formally. "It was a good try and a good
thought."
</p>
<p>
 "A good thought indeed," drawled Draco. "Why didn't anyone in
Hufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you'd
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 helped
instead of just Potter, you could've caught him. I thought
Hufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?"
</p>
<p>
 Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting
to die of shame. "We didn't think of it in time -"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah," said Draco, "didn't
 <em>
  think
 </em>
 of it, I guess that's
why it's better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend than all of
Hufflepuff."
</p>
<p>
 Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one... "You're
not helping," Harry said in a mild tone. Hoping Draco would
interpret that as
 <em>
  you're interfering with my plans, please shut
up.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Hey, what's this?" said Mr. Goyle. He stooped to the grass and
picked up something around the size of a large marble, a glass ball
that seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist.
</p>
<p>
 Ernie blinked. "Neville's Remembrall!"
</p>
<p>
 "What's a Remembrall?" asked Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "It turns red if you've forgotten something," Ernie said. "It
doesn't tell you what you forgot, though. Give it here, please, and
I'll hand it back to Neville later." Ernie held out his hand.
</p>
<p>
 A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle's face and he spun around
and raced away.
</p>
<p>
 Ernie stood still for a moment in surprise, and then shouted
"Hey!" and ran after Mr. Goyle.
</p>
<p>
 And Mr. Goyle grabbed a broomstick, hopped on with one smooth
motion and took to the air.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's jaw dropped. Hadn't Madam Hooch said that would get him
 <em>
  expelled?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "That idiot!
 </em>
 " Draco hissed. He opened his mouth to
shout -
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Hey!
 </em>
 " shouted Ernie. "That's Neville's!
 <em>
  Give it
back!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 The Slytherins started cheering and hooting.
</p>
<p>
 Draco's mouth snapped shut. Harry caught the sudden look of
indecision on his face.
</p>
<p>
 "Draco," Harry said in a low tone, "if you don't order that
idiot back on the ground, the teacher's going to get back and
-"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Come and get it, Hufflepuffle!
 </em>
 " shouted Mr. Goyle,
and a great cheer went up from the Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 "I
 <em>
  can't!
 </em>
 " whispered Draco. "Everyone in Slytherin
would think I'm
 <em>
  weak!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "And if Mr. Goyle gets expelled," hissed Harry, "your
 <em>
  father
 </em>
 is going to think you're a
 <em>
  moron!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Draco's face twisted in agony.
</p>
<p>
 At that moment -
</p>
<p>
 "Hey,
 <em>
  Slytherslime
 </em>
 ," shouted Ernie, "didn't anyone ever
tell you that Hufflepuffs stick together?
 <em>
  Wands out,
Hufflepuff!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 And there were suddenly a whole lot of wands pointed in Mr.
Goyle's direction.
</p>
<p>
 Three seconds later -
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Wands out, Slytherin!
 </em>
 " said around five different
Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 And there were a whole lot of wands pointed in Hufflepuff's
direction.
</p>
<p>
 Two seconds later -
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Wands out, Gryffindor!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Do something, Potter!
 </em>
 " whispered Draco. "
 <em>
  I can't
be the one to stop this it has to be you! I'll owe you a favour
just think of something aren't you supposed to be
brilliant?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 In around five and a half seconds, realised Harry, someone was
going to cast the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex and by the time it was
over and the teachers were done expelling people the only boys left
in his year would be Ravenclaws.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Wands out, Ravenclaw!
 </em>
 " shouted Michael Corner who was
apparently feeling left out of the disaster.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  GREGORY GOYLE!"
 </em>
 screamed Harry
 <em>
  . "I challenge you
to a contest for possession of Neville's Remembrall!"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a sudden pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, really?" said Draco in the loudest drawl Harry had ever
heard. "That sounds interesting. What sort of contest, Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 Er...
</p>
<p>
 "Contest" had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten.
What sort of contest, he couldn't say "chess" because Draco
wouldn't be able to accept without it looking strange, he couldn't
say "arm-wrestling" because Mr. Goyle would crush him -
</p>
<p>
 "How about this?" Harry said loudly. "Gregory Goyle and I stand
apart from each other, and no one else is allowed to come near
either of us. We don't use our wands and neither does anyone else.
I don't move from where I'm standing, and neither does he. And if I
can get my hands on Neville's Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle
relinquishes all claim to that Remembrall he's holding and gives it
to me."
</p>
<p>
 There was another pause as people's looks of relief transmuted
to confusion.
</p>
<p>
 "Hah, Potter!" said Draco loudly. "I'd like to see you do
 <em>
  that!
 </em>
 Mr. Goyle accepts!"
</p>
<p>
 "It's on!" said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "Potter,
 <em>
  what?
 </em>
 " whispered Draco, which he somehow did
without moving his lips.
</p>
<p>
 Harry didn't know how to answer without moving his.
</p>
<p>
 People were putting their wands away, and Mr. Goyle swooped
gracefully to the ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs
started over towards Mr. Goyle, but Harry shot them a desperately
pleading look and they backed off.
</p>
<p>
 Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle and stopped when he was a few
paces away, far enough apart that they couldn't reach each
other.
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed his wand.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone else backed away.
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed. He knew in broad outline what he
 <em>
  wanted
 </em>
 to do, but it had to be done in such a way that no
one understood
 <em>
  what
 </em>
 he'd done -
</p>
<p>
 "All right," Harry said loudly. "And now..." He took a deep
breath and raised one hand, fingers ready to snap. There were gasps
from anyone who'd heard about the pies, which was practically
everyone. "
 <em>
  I call upon the insanity of Hogwarts! Happy happy
boom boom swamp swamp swamp!
 </em>
 " And Harry snapped his
fingers.
</p>
<p>
 A lot of people flinched.
</p>
<p>
 And nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
 Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing,
until...
</p>
<p>
 "Um," someone said. "Is that it?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked at the boy who'd spoken. "Look in front of you. You
see that patch of ground that looks barren, without any grass on
it?"
</p>
<p>
 "Um, yeah," said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).
</p>
<p>
 "Dig it up."
</p>
<p>
 Now Harry was getting a lot of strange looks.
</p>
<p>
 "Er, why?" said Dean something.
</p>
<p>
 "Just do it," said Terry Boot in a weary voice. "No point asking
why, trust me on this one."
</p>
<p>
 Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.
</p>
<p>
 After a minute or so, Dean stood up again. "There's nothing
there," Dean said.
</p>
<p>
 Huh. Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a
treasure map that would lead to another treasure map that would
lead to Neville's Remembrall which he would put there after getting
it back from Mr. Goyle...
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry realised there was a much simpler way which didn't
threaten the secret of Time-Turners quite as much.
</p>
<p>
 "Thanks, Dean!" Harry said loudly. "Ernie, would you look around
on the ground where Neville fell and see if you can find Neville's
Remembrall?"
</p>
<p>
 People looked even more confused.
</p>
<p>
 "Just do it," said Terry Boot. "He'll keep trying until
something works, and the scary thing is that -"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Merlin!
 </em>
 " gasped Ernie. He was holding up Neville's
Remembrall. "It's
 <em>
  here!
 </em>
 Right where he fell!"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
 " cried Mr. Goyle. He looked down and saw...
</p>
<p>
 ...that he was still holding Neville's Remembrall.
</p>
<p>
 There was a rather long pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Er," said Dean something, "that's not possible, is it?"
</p>
<p>
 "It's a plot hole," said Harry. "I made myself weird enough to
distract the universe for a moment and it forgot that Goyle had
already picked up the Remembrall."
</p>
<p>
 "No, wait, I mean, that's
 <em>
  totally
 </em>
 not possible -"
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me, are we all standing around here waiting to go flying
on broomsticks? Yes we are. So shut up. Anyway, once I get my hands
on Neville's Remembrall, the contest is over and Gregory Goyle has
to relinquish all claim to the Remembrall he's holding and give it
to me. Those were the terms, remember?" Harry stretched out a hand
and beckoned Ernie. "Just roll it over here, since no one's
supposed to get close to me, okay?"
</p>
<p>
 "Hold on!" shouted a Slytherin - Blaise Zabini, Harry wasn't
likely to forget that name. "How do we know that's Neville's
Remembrall? You could've just dropped
 <em>
  another
 </em>
 Remembrall
there -"
</p>
<p>
 "The Slytherin is strong with this one," Harry said, smiling.
"But you have my word that the one Ernie's holding is Neville's. No
comment about the one Gregory Goyle's holding."
</p>
<p>
 Zabini spun to Draco. "
 <em>
  Malfoy!
 </em>
 You're not just going to
let him get away with that -"
</p>
<p>
 "Shut up, you," rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. "Mr.
Malfoy doesn't need
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 to tell him what to do!"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Good
 </em>
 minion.
</p>
<p>
 "My bet was with Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
Malfoy," Harry said. "Not with you, Zabini. I have done what Mr.
Malfoy said he'd like to see me do, and as for the judgment of the
bet, I leave that up to Mr. Malfoy." Harry inclined his head
towards Draco and raised his eyebrows slightly. That ought to allow
Draco to save enough face.
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause.
</p>
<p>
 "You promise that actually
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 Neville's Remembrall?"
Draco said.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said. "That's the one that'll go back to Neville
and it was his originally. And the one Gregory Goyle's holding goes
to me."
</p>
<p>
 Draco nodded, looking decisive. "I won't question the word of
the Noble House of Potter, then, no matter how strange that all
was. And the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy keeps its word
as well. Mr. Goyle, give that to Mr. Potter -"
</p>
<p>
 "Hey!" Zabini said. "He hasn't won
 <em>
  yet
 </em>
 , he hasn't got
his hands on -"
</p>
<p>
 "Catch, Harry!" said Ernie, and he tossed the Remembrall.
</p>
<p>
 Harry easily snapped the Remembrall out of the air, he'd always
had good reflexes that way. "There," said Harry, "I win..."
</p>
<p>
 Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.
</p>
<p>
 The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like
a miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad
daylight.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 Thursday.
</p>
<p>
 If you wanted to be specific, 5:09pm on Thursday afternoon, in
Professor McGonagall's office, after flying classes. (With an extra
hour for Harry slipped in between.)
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall sitting on her stool. Harry in the hot seat
in front of her desk.
</p>
<p>
 "Professor," Harry said tightly, "Slytherin was pointing their
wands at Hufflepuff, Gryffindor was pointing their wands at
Slytherin, some
 <em>
  idiot
 </em>
 called wands out in Ravenclaw, and I
had maybe five seconds to keep the whole thing from blowing
sky-high! It was all I could think of!"
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall's face was pinched and angry. "
 <em>
  You are
not to use the Time-Turner in that fashion, Mr. Potter!
 </em>
 Is the
concept of secrecy not something that you understand?"
</p>
<p>
 "They don't
 <em>
  know
 </em>
 how I did it! They just think I can do
really weird things by snapping my fingers! I've done other weird
stuff that can't be done with Time-Turners even, and I'll do
 <em>
  more
 </em>
 stuff like that, and
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 case won't even
stand out! I
 <em>
  had to do it,
 </em>
 Professor!"
</p>
<p>
 "You did
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 have to do it!" snapped Professor
McGonagall. "All you needed to do was get this
 <em>
  anonymous
Slytherin
 </em>
 back on the ground and the wands put away! You could
have challenged him to a game of Exploding Snap but no, you had to
use the Time-Turner in a flagrant and unnecessary manner!"
</p>
<p>
 "It was all I could think of! I don't even know what Exploding
Snap
 <em>
  is,
 </em>
 they wouldn't have accepted a game of chess and
if I'd picked arm-wresting I would have lost!"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Then you should have picked wrestling!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked. "But then I'd have
 <em>
  lost
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 Harry stopped.
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall was looking
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 angry.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry, Professor McGonagall," Harry said in a small voice.
"I honestly didn't think of that, and you're right, I should have,
it would have been brilliant if I had, but I just didn't think of
that at all..."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's voice trailed off. It was suddenly apparent to him that
he'd had a
 <em>
  lot
 </em>
 of other options. He could have asked
 <em>
  Draco
 </em>
 to suggest something, he could have asked the
crowd... his use of the Time-Turner
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been flagrant and
unnecessary. There had been a giant space of possibilities, why had
he picked
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 one?
</p>
<p>
 Because he'd seen a way to
 <em>
  win.
 </em>
 Win possession of an
unimportant trinket that the teachers would've taken back from Mr.
Goyle anyway.
</p>
<p>
 Intent to win. That was what had gotten him.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry," Harry said again. "For my pride and my
stupidity."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall wiped a hand across her forehead. Some of
her anger seemed to dissipate. But her voice still came out very
hard. "One more display like that, Mr. Potter, and you will be
returning that Time-Turner. Do I make myself very clear?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said. "I understand and I'm sorry."
</p>
<p>
 "Then, Mr. Potter, you will be allowed to retain the Time-Turner
for now. And considering the size of the debacle you did, in fact,
avert, I will not deduct any points from Ravenclaw."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Plus you couldn't explain why you'd deducted the
points.
 </em>
 But Harry wasn't dumb enough to say that out loud.
</p>
<p>
 "More importantly, why did the Remembrall go off like that?"
Harry said. "Does it mean I've been Obliviated?"
</p>
<p>
 "That puzzles me as well," Professor McGonagall said slowly. "If
it were that simple, I would think that the courts would use
Remembralls, and they do not. I shall look into it, Mr. Potter."
She sighed. "You can go now."
</p>
<p>
 Harry started to get up from his chair, then halted. "Um, sorry,
I did have something else I wanted to tell you -"
</p>
<p>
 You could hardly see the flinch. "What is it, Mr. Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "It's about Professor Quirrell -"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sure, Mr. Potter, that it is nothing of importance."
Professor McGonagall spoke the words in a great rush. "Surely you
heard the Headmaster tell the students that you were not to bother
us with any unimportant complaints about the Defence
Professor?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was rather confused. "But this could
 <em>
  be
 </em>
 important, yesterday I got this sudden sense of doom when -"
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter! I have a sense of doom as well! And my sense of
doom is suggesting that
 <em>
  you must not finish that
sentence!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry's mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall had succeeded;
Harry was speechless.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "if you have discovered
anything that seems interesting about Professor Quirrell, please
feel free not to share it with me or anyone else. Now I think
you've taken up enough of my valuable time -"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  This isn't like you!
 </em>
 " Harry burst out. "I'm sorry but
that just seems
 <em>
  unbelievably
 </em>
 irresponsible! From what I've
heard there's some kind of jinx on the Defence position, and if you
already
 <em>
  know
 </em>
 something's going to go wrong, I'd think
you'd all be on your toes -"
</p>
<p>
 "Go
 <em>
  wrong
 </em>
 , Mr. Potter?
 <em>
  I certainly hope not.
 </em>
 "
Professor McGonagall's face was expressionless. "After Professor
Blake was caught in a closet with no fewer than three fifth-year
Slytherins last February, and a year before that, Professor Summers
failed so completely as an educator that her students thought a
boggart was a kind of furniture, it would be
 <em>
  catastrophic
 </em>
 if some problem with the extraordinarily competent Professor
Quirrell came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our
students would fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s."
</p>
<p>
 "I see," Harry said slowly, taking it all in. "So in other
words, whatever's wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately
don't want to know about it until the end of the school year. And
since it's currently September, he could assassinate the Prime
Minister on live television and get away with it so far as you're
concerned."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall gazed at him unblinkingly. "I am certain
that I could never be heard endorsing such a statement, Mr. Potter.
At Hogwarts we strive to be proactive with respect to
 <em>
  anything
 </em>
 that threatens the educational attainment of our
students."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Such as first-year Ravenclaws who can't keep their mouths
shut.
 </em>
 "I believe I understand you completely, Professor
McGonagall."
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much."
Professor McGonagall leaned forward, her face tightening again.
"Since you and I have already discussed matters far more sensitive
than these, I shall speak frankly. You, and you alone, have
reported this mysterious sense of doom. You, and you alone, are a
chaos magnet the likes of which I have never seen. After our little
shopping trip to Diagon Alley, and
 <em>
  then
 </em>
 the Sorting Hat,
and then
 <em>
  today's
 </em>
 little episode, I can well foresee that I
am fated to sit in the Headmaster's office and hear some hilarious
tale about Professor Quirrell in which you and you alone play a
starring role, after which there will be no choice but to fire him.
I am already resigned to it, Mr. Potter. And if this sad event
takes place any earlier than the Ides of May, I will string you up
by the gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire
beetles into your nose.
 <em>
  Now
 </em>
 do you understand me
completely?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded, his eyes very wide. Then, after a second, "What do
I get if I can make it happen on the last day of the school
year?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Get out of my office!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 Thursday.
</p>
<p>
 There must have been something about Thursdays in Hogwarts.
</p>
<p>
 It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next
to Professor Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that
guarded the entrance to the Headmaster's office.
</p>
<p>
 No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office
to the Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to
report to Professor Flitwick's office, and there Harry had learned
that Dumbledore wanted to speak to him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick
if the Headmaster had said what this was about.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.
</p>
<p>
 Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to
invoke the words of power and madness.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp?
 </em>
 Harry had
thought but not said aloud.
</p>
<p>
 "Please don't worry too much, Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor
Flitwick from somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry was
grateful for Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was hard
getting used to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but
spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) "Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a
little odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never
hurt a student in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will."
Professor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. "Just keep that
in mind at all times and you'll be sure not to panic!"
</p>
<p>
 This was not helping.
</p>
<p>
 "Good luck!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the
gargoyle and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at
all. (Of course, the password wouldn't be much good if you could
hear someone saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a
very natural and ordinary movement that Harry found rather
shocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable
stone the whole time.
</p>
<p>
 Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs.
There was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more
disturbing was that
 <em>
  revolving
 </em>
 the spiral ought not to take
you anywhere.
</p>
<p>
 "Up you go!" squeaked Flitwick.
</p>
<p>
 Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found
himself, for some reason that his brain couldn't seem to visualise
at all, moving upwards.
</p>
<p>
 The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral
stairs kept turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a
rather dizzying time, Harry found himself in front of an oak door
with a brass griffin knocker.
</p>
<p>
 Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.
</p>
<p>
 The door swung open.
</p>
<p>
 And Harry saw the most interesting room he'd ever seen in his
life.
</p>
<p>
 There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or
slowly changed shape or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were
dozens of mysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers,
all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into
interesting shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them.
There were things that looked like clocks with many hands,
inscribed with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a
bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand
colors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden cup
filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon
encrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with pictures of
people sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a
hatrack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers
for left feet.
</p>
<p>
 In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk.
Before the desk was an oaken stool. And behind the desk was a
well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
Dumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat like a
squashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three
layers of bright pink pyjamas.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad
intensity.
</p>
<p>
 With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the
desk. The door swung shut behind him with a loud
 <em>
  thunk.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 "Hello, Headmaster," Harry replied. So they were on a first-name
basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him -
</p>
<p>
 "Please, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Headmaster sounds so formal.
Just call me Heh for short."
</p>
<p>
 "I'll be sure to, Heh," said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 There was a slight pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Do you know," said Dumbledore, "you're the first person who's
ever taken me up on that?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said. He tried to control his voice despite the
sudden sinking feeling in his stomach. "I'm sorry, I, ah,
Headmaster, you told me to do it so I did -"
</p>
<p>
 "Heh, please!" said Dumbledore cheerfully. "And there's no call
to be so worried, I won't launch you out a window just because you
make one mistake. I'll give you plenty of warnings first, if you're
doing something wrong! Besides, what matters isn't how people talk
to you, it's what they think of you."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  He's never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and
you'll be sure not to panic.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open,
showing some small yellow lumps. "Sherbet lemon?" said the
Headmaster.
</p>
<p>
 "Er, no thank you, Heh," said Harry.
 <em>
  Does slipping a student
LSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into the category of
harmless fun?
 </em>
 "You, um, said something about my being too
young to invoke the words of power and madness?"
</p>
<p>
 "That you most certainly are!" Dumbledore said. "Thankfully the
Words of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago and no one
has the slightest idea what they are anymore. It was just a little
remark."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said. He was aware that his mouth was hanging
open. "Why did you call me here, then?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Why?
 </em>
 " Dumbledore repeated. "Ah, Harry, if I went
around all day asking
 <em>
  why
 </em>
 I do things, I'd never have time
to get a single thing done! I'm quite a busy person, you know."
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded, smiling. "Yes, it was a very impressive list.
Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and
Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.
Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than
six hours if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it's pretty
impressive if you're doing all that on just thirty hours a
day."
</p>
<p>
 There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on
smiling. He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive,
but once it had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately
messing with him, something within him
 <em>
  absolutely refused
 </em>
 to sit and take it like a defenceless lump.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much,"
said Dumbledore after the slight pause, "and yet we ourselves seem
to be a little too large for it, and so it's a constant struggle to
fit our lives into Time."
</p>
<p>
 "Indeed," Harry said with grave solemnity. "That's why it's best
to come to our points quickly."
</p>
<p>
 For a moment Harry wondered if he'd gone too far.
</p>
<p>
 Then Dumbledore chuckled. "Straight to the point it shall be."
The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat
and brushing his beard against his desk. "Harry, this Monday you
did something that should have been impossible even with a
Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible with
 <em>
  only
 </em>
 a
Time-Turner. Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?"
</p>
<p>
 A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He'd done that using
the Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a
Christmas box along with a note, and that note had said:
 <em>
  If
Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he
would never let it escape his grasp.
 </em>
 <em>
  ...
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "A natural thought," Dumbledore went on, "is that since none of
the first-years present were able to cast such a spell, someone
else was present, and yet unseen. And if no one could see them,
why, it would be easy enough for them to throw the pies. One might
further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the
invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far
beyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak."
Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. "Am I on the right track so
far, Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would
not at all be wise, and possibly not the least bit helpful, and he
couldn't think of anything else to say.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. "Don't worry, Harry, you
haven't done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren't against the
rules - I suppose they're rare enough that no one ever got around
to putting them on the list. But really I was wondering something
else entirely."
</p>
<p>
 "Oh?" Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm. "You see, Harry, after
you've been through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of
these things. You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the
world. You begin to harbour suspicions
 <em>
  before
 </em>
 the moment
of revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an
invisibility cloak made its way into your hands only four days
after you discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for
sale in Diagon Alley, but there is
 <em>
  one
 </em>
 which might find
its own way to a destined wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder
if by some strange chance you have found not just
 <em>
  an
 </em>
 invisibility cloak, but
 <em>
  the
 </em>
 Cloak of Invisibility, one of
the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the
gaze of Death himself." Dumbledore's gaze was bright and eager.
"May I see it, Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his
system now and it was entirely useless, this was the most powerful
wizard in the world and there was no way he could make it out the
door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for him to hide if he did,
he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down through
the Potters for who knew how long -
</p>
<p>
 Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright
light had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a little
sorrowful. "Harry," said Dumbledore, "if you don't want to, you can
just say no."
</p>
<p>
 "I can?" Harry croaked.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, Harry," said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, and
worried. "It seems that you're afraid of me, Harry. May I ask what
I've done to earn your distrust?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed. "Is there some way you can swear a binding
magical oath that you won't take my cloak?"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore shook his head slowly. "Unbreakable Vows are not to
be used so lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know
the spell, you would have only my word that the spell was binding.
Yet surely you realise that I do not
 <em>
  need
 </em>
 your permission
to see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself,
mokeskin pouch or no." Dumbledore's face was very grave. "But this
I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from
you. Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to
show it to me. That is a promise and an oath. Should I need to
prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will require
you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood
of adrenaline and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off
his belt. "If you really
 <em>
  don't
 </em>
 need my permission... then
you have it." Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore, and bit down
hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he was
Obliviated afterwards.
</p>
<p>
 The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any
word of retrieval, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah," breathed Dumbledore. "I was right..." He poured the
shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand. "Centuries old, and
still as perfect as the day it was made. We have lost much of our
art over the years, and now I cannot make such a thing myself, no
one can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a
song forever being sung without anyone to hear it..." The wizard
looked up from the Cloak. "Do not sell it," he said, "do not give
it to anyone as a possession. Think twice before you show it to
anyone, and ponder three times again before you reveal it is a
Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing
of Power."
</p>
<p>
 For a moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful...
</p>
<p>
 ...and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.
</p>
<p>
 Harry put it back in his pouch.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore's face was grave once more. "May I ask again, Harry,
how you came to distrust me so?"
</p>
<p>
 Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.
</p>
<p>
 "There was a note with the Cloak," Harry said in a small voice.
"It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew.
I don't know who left the note, though, I really don't."
</p>
<p>
 "I... see," Dumbledore said slowly. "Well, Harry, I won't impugn
the motives of whoever left you that note. Who knows but that they
themselves may have had the best of good intentions? They did give
you the Cloak, after all."
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore's charity, and abashed at
the sharp contrast with his own attitude.
</p>
<p>
 The old wizard went on. "But you and I are both gamepieces of
the same color, I think. The boy who finally defeated Voldemort,
and the old man who held him off long enough for you to save the
day. I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all
do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice and
ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me."
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry," Harry said. He felt wretched at this point, he'd
just told off Gandalf essentially, and Dumbledore's kindness was
only making him feel worse. "I shouldn't have distrusted you."
</p>
<p>
 "Alas, Harry, in this world..." The old wizard shook his head.
"I cannot even say you were unwise. You did not know me. And in
truth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to
trust. Perhaps even some you call friends."
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. "Like who?"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of
his instruments, a dial with eight hands of varying length.
</p>
<p>
 After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again. "He probably
seems to you quite charming," said Dumbledore. "Polite - to you at
least. Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready with a
helping hand, a favour, a word of advice -"
</p>
<p>
 "Oh,
 <em>
  Draco Malfoy!
 </em>
 " Harry said, feeling rather
relieved that it wasn't Hermione or something. "Oh no, no no no,
you've got it all wrong, he's not turning me, I'm turning him."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore froze where he was peering at the dial. "You're
 <em>
  what?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "I'm going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side," Harry said.
"You know, make him a good guy."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one
of the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone,
let alone someone with a long silver beard. "Are you certain," said
the old wizard after a moment, "that he is ready to be redeemed? I
fear that whatever goodness you think you see within him is only
wishful thinking - or worse, a lure, a bait -"
</p>
<p>
 "Er, not likely," Harry said. "I mean if he's trying to disguise
himself as a good guy he's incredibly bad at it. This isn't a
question of Draco coming up to me and being all charming and me
deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down. I
selected him for redemption specifically because he's the heir to
House Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would
obviously be him."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore's left eye twitched. "You intend to sow seeds of love
and kindness in Draco Malfoy's heart because you expect Malfoy's
heir to prove valuable to you?"
</p>
<p>
 "Not just to
 <em>
  me!
 </em>
 " Harry said indignantly. "To all of
magical Britain, if this works out!
 <em>
  And
 </em>
 he'll have a
happier and mentally healthier life himself! Look, I don't have
enough time to turn
 <em>
  everyone
 </em>
 away from the Dark Side and
I've got to ask where the Light can gain the most advantage the
fastest -"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry
would expect, almost howling. It seemed positively
 <em>
  undignified.
 </em>
 An ancient and powerful wizard ought to
chuckle in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was gasping for
breath. Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while
watching the Marx Brothers movie
 <em>
  Duck Soup,
 </em>
 and that was
how hard Dumbledore was laughing now.
</p>
<p>
 "It's not
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 funny," Harry said after a while. He was
starting to worry about Dumbledore's sanity again.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible
effort. "Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is
that you begin laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny,
because when you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!" The
old wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft
evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's brain took a moment to place the familiar words... "Hey,
that's a
 <em>
  Tolkien
 </em>
 quote!
 <em>
  Gandalf
 </em>
 says that!"
</p>
<p>
 "Theoden, actually," said Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 "You're
 <em>
  Muggleborn?
 </em>
 " Harry said in shock.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm afraid not," said Dumbledore, smiling again. "I was born
seventy years before that book was published, dear child. But it
seems that my Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain
ways. I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of
 <em>
  The
Lord of the Rings
 </em>
 and three sets of Tolkien's entire collected
works, and I treasure every one of them." Dumbledore drew his wand
and held it up and struck a pose. "
 <em>
  You cannot pass!
 </em>
 How
does that look?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah," Harry said in something approaching complete brain
shutdown, "I think you're missing a Balrog." And the pink pyjamas
and squashed mushroom hat were not helping in the slightest.
</p>
<p>
 "I see." Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his
belt. "I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of
late. Nowadays it's all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try
desperately to prevent any work from getting done, and formal
dinners where foreign politicians compete to see who can be the
most obstinate fool. And being mysterious at people, knowing things
I have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only
be understood in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which
powerful wizards amuse themselves after they have left the part of
the pattern that allows them to be heroes. Speaking of which,
Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something which
belonged to your father."
</p>
<p>
 "You do?" said Harry. "Gosh, who would have figured."
</p>
<p>
 "Yes indeed," said Dumbledore. "I suppose it is a little
predictable, isn't it?" His face turned solemn.
"Nonetheless..."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one
of the drawers as he did so. He reached in using both arms, and,
straining slightly, pulled a rather large and heavy-looking object
out of the drawer, which he then deposited on his oaken desk with a
huge thunk.
</p>
<p>
 "This," Dumbledore said, "was your father's rock."
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly
shaped, sharp-edged, and very much a plain old ordinary large rock.
Dumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest
available cross-section, but it still wobbled unstably on his
desk.
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked up. "This is a joke, right?"
</p>
<p>
 "It is not," said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very
serious. "I took this from the ruins of James and Lily's home in
Godric's Hollow, where also I found you; and I have kept it from
then until now, against the day when I could give it to you."
</p>
<p>
 In the mixture of hypotheses that served as Harry's model of the
world, Dumbledore's insanity was rapidly rising in probability. But
there
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 still a substantial amount of probability
allocated to other alternatives... "Um, is it a
 <em>
  magical
 </em>
 rock?"
</p>
<p>
 "Not so far as I know," said Dumbledore. "But I advise you with
the greatest possible stringency to keep it close about your person
at all times."
</p>
<p>
 All right. Dumbledore was
 <em>
  probably
 </em>
 insane but if he
 <em>
  wasn't
 </em>
 ... well, it would be just too
 <em>
  embarrassing
 </em>
 to get in trouble from ignoring the advice of the inscrutable old
wizard. That had to be like #4 on the list of the Top 100 Obvious
Failure Modes.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to
find some angle from which to lift it without cutting himself.
"I'll put it in my pouch, then."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore frowned. "That may not be close enough to your
person. And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?"
</p>
<p>
 "You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look. "That might prove
wise."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said. It looked rather heavy. "I'd think the other
students would tend to ask me questions about that."
</p>
<p>
 "Tell them I ordered you to do it," said Dumbledore. "No one
will question that, since they all think I'm insane." His face was
still perfectly serious.
</p>
<p>
 "Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to
carry large rocks I can kind of see why people would think
that."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, a sweep
of one hand that seemed to take in all the mysterious instruments
around the room. "When we are young we believe that we know
everything, and so we believe that if we see no explanation for
something, then no explanation exists. When we are older we realise
that the whole universe works by a rhythm and a reason, even if we
ourselves do not know it. It is only our own ignorance which
appears to us as insanity."
</p>
<p>
 "Reality is always lawful," said Harry, "even if we don't know
the law."
</p>
<p>
 "Precisely, Harry," said Dumbledore. "To understand this - and I
see that you
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 understand it - is the essence of
wisdom."
</p>
<p>
 "So...
 <em>
  why
 </em>
 do I have to carry this rock exactly?"
</p>
<p>
 "I can't think of a reason, actually," said Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 "...you can't."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore nodded. "But just because I can't think of a reason
doesn't mean there
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 no reason."
</p>
<p>
 The instruments ticked on.
</p>
<p>
 "Okay," said Harry, "I'm not even sure if I should be saying
this, but that is simply not the correct way to deal with our
admitted ignorance of how the universe works."
</p>
<p>
 "It isn't?" said the old wizard, looking surprised and
disappointed.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work
out in his favour, but he carried on regardless. "No. I don't even
know if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one
up myself, it would be 'privileging the hypothesis' or something
like that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose you had a
million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And
you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector
always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the
time on boxes that didn't have a diamond. If you ran twenty
detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average, one false
candidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take
one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true
candidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible
answers,
 <em>
  most
 </em>
 of the evidence you need goes into just
 <em>
  locating
 </em>
 the true hypothesis out of millions of
possibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place.
The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three
plausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just
jump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility
to the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the
work. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people,
and there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no
evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that
Mortimer Snodgrass did it?"
</p>
<p>
 "Did he?" said Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 "No," said Harry. "But later it turns out that the murderer had
black hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah,
looks like Mortimer did it after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer
for the police to
 <em>
  promote him to their attention
 </em>
 without
having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are
lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just
 <em>
  locating
 </em>
 the true answer - starting to pay attention to
it. You don't need
 <em>
  proof
 </em>
 , or the sort of official evidence
that scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of
 <em>
  hint
 </em>
 , and that hint has to discriminate that particular
possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can't just
pluck the right answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a
possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there's got
to be a million other things I could do besides carrying around my
father's rock. Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't
mean that I'm unsure about how I should reason in the presence of
my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no
less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what
you just did is
 <em>
  not allowed.
 </em>
 " Harry paused.
"
 <em>
  Unless
 </em>
 , of course, you have some
 <em>
  hint
 </em>
 you're not
mentioning."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful.
"An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at
the point where you make an analogy between a million potential
murderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out
of many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of
action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father's
rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is
wiser to do than not."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had
accessed earlier, this time seeming to root around inside - at
least his arm seemed to be moving. "I will remark," Dumbledore said
while Harry was still trying to sort out how to reply to this
completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common misconception
of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there, leaving
none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw
indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which
is not at all the same quality as being intelligent." The wizard
was smiling as he bent over the drawer. "Nonetheless, you
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 seem rather intelligent. Less like an ordinary young
hero and more like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may
have been taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and that you
may be able to understand things that few others could grasp. So I
shall be daring, and offer you a certain
 <em>
  other
 </em>
 heirloom."
</p>
<p>
 "You don't mean..." gasped Harry. "My father...
 <em>
  owned
another rock?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me," said Dumbledore, "I
 <em>
  am
 </em>
 still older and
more mysterious than you and if there are any revelations to be
made then
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 will do the revealing, thank you... oh, where
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 that thing!" Dumbledore reached down further into the
desk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and whole
torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking
out, as though the desk drawer was eating him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry couldn't help but wonder just how much stuff was in there
and what the complete inventory would look like.
</p>
<p>
 Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the
objective of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside
the rock.
</p>
<p>
 It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook:
 <em>
  Intermediate Potion Making
 </em>
 by Libatius Borage. There was a
picture of a smoking vial on the cover.
</p>
<p>
 "This," Dumbledore intoned, "was your mother's fifth-year
Potions textbook."
</p>
<p>
 "Which I am to carry with me at all times," said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Which holds a terrible secret
 </em>
 . A secret whose
revelation could prove so disastrous that I must ask you to swear -
and I do require you to swear it seriously, Harry, whatever you may
think of all this - never to tell anyone or anything else."
</p>
<p>
 Harry considered his mother's fifth-year Potions textbook,
which, apparently, held a terrible secret.
</p>
<p>
 The problem was that Harry
 <em>
  did
 </em>
 take that oaths like
that very seriously. Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the
right sort of person.
</p>
<p>
 And...
</p>
<p>
 "I'm feeling thirsty," Harry said, "and that is not at all a
good sign."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this
cryptic statement. "
 <em>
  Do
 </em>
 you swear, Harry?" said Dumbledore.
His eyes gazed intently into Harry's. "Otherwise I cannot tell
you."
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," said Harry. "I swear." That was the trouble with being a
Ravenclaw. You couldn't refuse an offer like that or your curiosity
would eat you alive, and everyone else knew it.
</p>
<p>
 "And I swear in turn," said Dumbledore, "that what I am about to
tell you is the truth."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry
leaned in to see.
</p>
<p>
 "Do you see these notes," Dumbledore said in a voice so low it
was almost a whisper, "written in the margins of the book?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed to be
describing something called a
 <em>
  potion of eagle's splendour,
 </em>
 many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at
all and whose names didn't appear to derive from English. Scrawled
in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying,
 <em>
  I wonder
what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of
blueberries?
 </em>
 and immediately beneath was a reply in different
handwriting,
 <em>
  You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "I see them," said Harry. "What about them?"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl. "The ones in this
handwriting," he said, still in that low voice, "were written by
your mother. And the ones in
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 handwriting," moving his
finger to indicate the first scrawl, "were written by me. I would
turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was
sleeping. Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they
had the most amazing fights."
</p>
<p>
 That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the
Headmaster of Hogwarts
 <em>
  was,
 </em>
 in fact, crazy.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression. "Do you
understand the implications of what I have just told you,
Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ehhh..." Harry said. His voice seemed to be stuck. "Sorry...
I... not really..."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah well," said Dumbledore, and sighed. "I suppose your
cleverness has limits after all, then. Shall we all just pretend I
didn't say anything?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile. "Of course,"
Harry said. "You know it's actually getting rather late in the day
and I'm a bit hungry, so I should be going down to dinner, really"
and Harry made a beeline for the door.
</p>
<p>
 The doorknob entirely failed to turn.
</p>
<p>
 "You wound me, Harry," said Dumbledore's voice in quiet tones
that were coming from right behind him. "Do you not at least
realise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry slowly turned around.
</p>
<p>
 In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with
a long silver beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and
wearing what looked to Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink
pyjamas.
</p>
<p>
 Behind him was a door that didn't seem to be working at the
moment.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted
to lean on a wizard's staff he didn't have. "Really," said
Dumbledore, "you try anything new instead of following the same
pattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all
start running away." The old wizard shook his head in sorrow. "I'd
hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I'd heard that your own
friends also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not
believe the same of me?"
</p>
<p>
 "Please open the door," Harry said, his voice trembling. "If you
ever want me to trust you again, open the door."
</p>
<p>
 There was the sound behind him of a door opening.
</p>
<p>
 "There were more things I planned to say to you," Dumbledore
said, "and if you leave now, you will not know what they were."
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes Harry absolutely
 <em>
  hated
 </em>
 being a Ravenclaw.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  He's never hurt a student,
 </em>
 said Harry's Gryffindor
side.
 <em>
  Just keep remembering that and you'll be sure not to
panic. You're not going to run away just because things are getting
interesting, are you?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You can't just walk out on the Headmaster!
 </em>
 said the
Hufflepuff part.
 <em>
  What if he starts deducting House points? He
could make your school life very difficult if he decides he doesn't
like you!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't
quite manage to silence was pondering the potential advantages of
being one of the few friends of this mad old wizard who also
happened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump. And
unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than
Draco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying
things like
 <em>
  poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk
to, doesn't he?
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  you wouldn't want such a powerful man
to end up trusting someone less virtuous, would you?
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  I
wonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you
if, you know, you became friends with him
 </em>
 and even
 <em>
  I bet
he's got a reaallly interesting book collection.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You're all a bunch of lunatics,
 </em>
 Harry thought at the
entire assemblage, but he'd been unanimously outvoted by every
component part of himself.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out,
and deliberately closed it again. It was a costless sacrifice given
that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore could control his movements
regardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane
wizard was once more smiling and looking friendly. That was good,
maybe.
</p>
<p>
 "Please don't do that again," Harry said. "I don't like being
trapped."
</p>
<p>
 "I
 <em>
  am
 </em>
 sorry about that, Harry," said Dumbledore in what
sounded like tones of sincere apology. "But it would have been
terribly unwise to let you leave without your father's rock."
</p>
<p>
 "Of course," Harry said. "It wasn't reasonable of me to expect
the door to open before I put the quest items in my inventory."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore smiled and nodded.
</p>
<p>
 Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around
to the front of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave
up the rock in his eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.
</p>
<p>
 He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the
Widening Lip charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was
rather noisy and had a distinctly complaining sound to it.
</p>
<p>
 His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret
that was in fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.
</p>
<p>
 And then Harry's inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for
ingratiating himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had
been perfectly pitched in such a way as to gain the support of the
majority Ravenclaw faction.
</p>
<p>
 "So," Harry said. "Um. As long as I'm hanging around, I don't
suppose you would like to give me a bit of a tour of your office?
I'm a bit curious as to what some of these things are," and that
was his understatement for the month of September.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin.
"I'm flattered by your interest," said Dumbledore, "but I'm afraid
there isn't much to say." Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall
and pointed to a painting of a sleeping man. "These are portraits
of past Headmasters of Hogwarts." He turned and pointed to his
desk. "This is my desk." He pointed to his chair. "This is my chair
-"
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me," Harry said, "actually I was wondering about those."
Harry pointed to a small cube that was softly whispering
"blorple... blorple... blorple".
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, the little fiddly things?" said Dumbledore. "They came with
the Headmaster's office and I have absolutely no idea what most of
them do. Although
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 dial with the eight hands counts
the number of, let's call them sneezes, by left-handed witches
within the borders of France, you would not believe how much work
it took to nail that down. And
 <em>
  this
 </em>
 one with the golden
wibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never, ever going to
figure out what it's doing."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still
processing this. "Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe
the two of you have met. It told me that it was never again to be
placed on your head under any circumstances. You're only the
fourteenth student in history it's said that about, Baba Yaga was
another one and I'll tell you about the other twelve when you're
older. This is an umbrella. This is another umbrella." Dumbledore
took another few steps and turned around, now smiling quite
broadly. "And of course, most people who come to my office want to
see Fawkes."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden
platform.
</p>
<p>
 Harry came over, rather puzzled. "This is Fawkes?"
</p>
<p>
 "Fawkes is a phoenix," said Dumbledore. "Very rare, very
powerful magical creatures."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Harry said. He lowered his head and stared into the
tiny, beady black eyes, which showed not the slightest sign of
power or intelligence.
</p>
<p>
 "Ahhh..." Harry said again.
</p>
<p>
 He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird. It was
pretty hard to miss.
</p>
<p>
 "Umm..."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Say something intelligent!
 </em>
 Harry's mind roared at
itself.
 <em>
  Don't just stand there sounding like a gibbering
moron!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Well what the heck am I
 </em>
 supposed
 <em>
  to say?
 </em>
 Harry's mind fired back.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Anything!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You mean, anything besides "Fawkes is a chicken" -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yes! Anything but that!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?"
</p>
<p>
 "Their tears have the power to heal," Dumbledore said. "They are
creatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire
may extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another. The
tremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly,
and yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in
this world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate
themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or
sometimes an egg." Dumbledore came closer and inspected the
chicken, frowning. "Hm... looking a little peaky there, I'd
say."
</p>
<p>
 By the time this statement registered fully in Harry's mind, the
chicken was already on fire.
</p>
<p>
 The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much
as a single caw before it began to wither and char. The blaze was
brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no smell of
burning.
</p>
<p>
 And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun,
leaving behind a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden
platform.
</p>
<p>
 "Don't look so horrified, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Fawkes
hasn't been hurt." Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then
the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small
yellowish egg. "Look, here's an egg!"
</p>
<p>
 "Oh... wow... amazing..."
</p>
<p>
 "But now we really should get on with things," Dumbledore said.
Leaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to
his throne and seated himself. "It's almost time for dinner, after
all, and we wouldn't want to have to use our Time-Turners."
</p>
<p>
 There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of
Harry. Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the
Headmaster of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, things," said Harry's lips. "And then dinner."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You're sounding like a gibbering moron again
 </em>
 observed
Harry's Internal Critic.
</p>
<p>
 "Well," Dumbledore said. "I fear I have a confession to make,
Harry. A confession and an apology."
</p>
<p>
 "Apologies are good"
 <em>
  that doesn't even make sense! What am I
talking about?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The old wizard sighed deeply. "You may not still think so after
understanding what I have to say. I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been
manipulating you your entire life. It was I who consigned you to
the care of your wicked stepparents -"
</p>
<p>
 "My stepparents aren't wicked!" blurted Harry. "My
 <em>
  parents,
 </em>
 I mean!"
</p>
<p>
 "They aren't?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised and
disappointed. "Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the
pattern..."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs,
 <em>
  SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "No, no," said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, "I was
just trying to spare your feelings, they're actually very
wicked..."
</p>
<p>
 "They are?" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.
"What do they do?"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Talk fast
 </em>
 "they, ah, I have to do dishes and wash
problems and they don't let me read a lot of books and -"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah, good, that's good to hear," said Dumbledore, leaning back
again. He smiled in a sad sort of way. "I apologise for
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 , then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. I'm sorry to say,
Harry, that I am responsible for virtually everything bad that has
ever happened to you. I know that this will probably make you very
angry."
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, I'm very angry!" said Harry. "Grrr!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award
for the Worst Acting in the History of Ever.
</p>
<p>
 "And I just wanted you to know," Dumbledore said, "I wanted to
tell you as early as possible, in case something happens to one of
us later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that has
already happened, and everything that will."
</p>
<p>
 Moisture glistened in the old wizard's eyes.
</p>
<p>
 "And I'm very angry!" said Harry. "So angry that I want to leave
right now unless you've got anything else to say!"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Just GO before he sets you on fire!
 </em>
 shrieked Slytherin,
Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor.
</p>
<p>
 "I understand," said Dumbledore. "One last thing then, Harry.
You are
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 to attempt the forbidden door on the
third-floor corridor. There's no possible way you could get through
all the traps, and I wouldn't want to hear that you'd been hurt
trying. Why, I doubt that you could so much as open the first door,
since it's locked and you don't know the spell
 <em>
  Alohomora
-
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry spun around and bolted for the exit at top speed, the
doorknob turned agreeably in his hand and then he was racing down
the spiral stairs even as they turned, his feet almost stumbling
over themselves, in just a moment he was at the bottom and the
gargoyle was walking aside and Harry fired out of the stairwell
like a cannonball.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 Harry Potter.
</p>
<p>
 There must have been something about Harry Potter.
</p>
<p>
 It was Thursday for everyone, after all, and yet this sort of
thing didn't seem to happen to anyone else.
</p>
<p>
 It was 6:21pm on Thursday afternoon when Harry Potter, firing
out of the stairwell like a cannonball and accelerating at top
speed, ran directly into Minerva McGonagall as she was turning a
corner on her way to the Headmaster's office.
</p>
<p>
 Thankfully neither of them were much hurt. As had been explained
to Harry a little earlier in the day - back when he was refusing to
go anywhere near a broomstick again - Quidditch needed solid iron
Bludgers just to stand a decent chance of injuring the players,
since wizards tended to be a lot more resistant than Muggles to
impacts.
</p>
<p>
 Harry and Professor McGonagall did both end up on the floor, and
the parchments she had been carrying went all over the
corridor.
</p>
<p>
 There was a terrible, terrible pause.
</p>
<p>
 "Harry Potter," breathed Professor McGonagall from where she was
lying on the floor right next to Harry. Her voice rose to nearly a
shriek. "
 <em>
  What were you doing in the Headmaster's
office?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Nothing!" squeaked Harry.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  "Were you talking about the Defence Professor?"
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "No! Dumbledore called me up there and he gave me this big rock
and said it was my father's and I should carry it everywhere!"
</p>
<p>
 There was another terrible pause.
</p>
<p>
 "I see," said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer.
She stood up, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered
parchments, which jumped into a neat stack and scurried back
against the corridor wall as though to hide from her gaze. "My
sympathies, Mr. Potter, and I apologise for doubting you."
</p>
<p>
 "Professor McGonagall," Harry said. His voice was wavering. He
pushed himself off the floor, stood, and looked up at her
trustworthy,
 <em>
  sane
 </em>
 face. "Professor McGonagall..."
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, Mr. Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "Do you think I should?" Harry said in a small voice. "Carry my
father's rock everywhere?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall sighed. "That is between you and the
Headmaster, I'm afraid." She hesitated. "I will say that ignoring
the Headmaster completely is almost never wise. I
 <em>
  am
 </em>
 sorry
to hear of your dilemma, Mr. Potter, and if there's any way I
 <em>
  can
 </em>
 help you with whatever you decide to do -"
</p>
<p>
 "Um," Harry said. "Actually I was thinking that once I know how,
I could Transfigure the rock into a ring and wear it on my finger.
If you could teach me how to sustain a Transfiguration -"
</p>
<p>
 "It is good that you asked me first," Professor McGonagall said,
her face growing a bit stern. "If you lost control of the
Transfiguration the reversal would cut off your finger and probably
rip your hand in half. And at your age, even a ring is too large a
target for you to sustain indefinitely without it being a serious
drain on your magic. But I can have a ring forged for you with a
setting for a jewel, a
 <em>

 "
</p>
<p>
 "Yes. Ah... um..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall sighed. "That's a bit strange even for
him." She stooped and picked up the stack of parchments. "I'm sorry
about this, Mr. Potter. I apologise again for mistrusting you. But
now it's my own turn to see the Headmaster."
</p>
<p>
 "Ah... good luck, I guess. Er..."
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you, Mr. Potter."
</p>
<p>
 "Um..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor McGonagall walked over to the gargoyle, inaudibly
spoke the password, and stepped through into the revolving spiral
stairs. She began to rise out of sight, and the gargoyle started
back -

<p>
 It was breakfast time on Friday morning. Harry took another huge
bite out of his toast and then tried to remind his brain that
scarfing his breakfast wouldn't actually get him into the dungeons
any faster. Anyway they had a full hour of study time between
breakfast and the start of Potions.
</p>
<p>
 But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry's imagination was already
sketching the chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, and patches
of glowing moss. Would there be rats? Would there be
 <em>
  dragons?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "Harry Potter," said a quiet voice from behind him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked over his shoulder and found himself beholding Ernie
Macmillan, smartly dressed in yellow-trimmed robes and looking a
little worried.
</p>
<p>
 "Neville thought I should warn you," Ernie said in a low voice.
"I think he's right. Be careful of the Potions Master in our
session today. The older Hufflepuffs told us that Professor Snape
can be really nasty to people he doesn't like, and he doesn't like
most people who aren't Slytherins. If you say anything smart to him
it... it could be really bad for you, from what I've heard. Just
keep your head down and don't give him any reason to notice
you."
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause as Harry processed this, and then he lifted
his eyebrows. (Harry wished he could raise just one eyebrow, like
Spock, but he'd never been able to manage.) "Thanks," Harry said.
"You might've just saved me a lot of trouble."
</p>
<p>
 Ernie nodded, and turned to go back to the Hufflepuff table.
</p>
<p>
 Harry resumed eating his toast.
</p>
<p>
 It was around four bites afterward that someone said "Pardon
me," and Harry turned around to see an older Ravenclaw, looking a
little worried -
</p>
<p>
 Some time later, Harry was finishing up his third plate of
rashers. (He'd learned to eat heavily at breakfast. He could always
eat lightly at lunch if he didn't end up using the Time-Turner.)
And there was yet another voice from behind him saying "Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said wearily, "I'll try not to draw Professor
Snape's attention -"
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, that's hopeless," said Fred.
</p>
<p>
 "Completely hopeless," said George.
</p>
<p>
 "So we had the house elves bake you a cake," said Fred.
</p>
<p>
 "We're going to put one candle on it for every point you lose
for Ravenclaw," said George.
</p>
<p>
 "And have a party for you at the Gryffindor table during lunch,"
said Fred.
</p>
<p>
 "We hope that'll cheer you up afterward," finished George.
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed his last bite of rasher and turned around. "All
right," said Harry. "I wasn't going to ask this after Professor
Binns, I really wasn't, but if Professor Snape is
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 awful why hasn't he been fired?"
</p>
<p>
 "Fired?" said Fred.
</p>
<p>
 "You mean, let go?" said George.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said. "It's what you do to bad teachers. You fire
them. Then you hire a better teacher instead. You don't have unions
or tenure here, right?"
</p>
<p>
 Fred and George were frowning in much the same way that
hunter-gatherer tribal elders might frown if you tried to tell them
about calculus.
</p>
<p>
 "I don't know," said Fred after a while. "I never thought about
that."
</p>
<p>
 "Me neither," said George.
</p>
<p>
 "Yeah," said Harry, "I get that a lot. See you at lunch, guys,
and don't blame me if there aren't any candles on that cake."
</p>
<p>
 Fred and George both laughed, as if Harry had said something
funny, and bowed to him and headed back toward Gryffindor.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned back to the breakfast table and grabbed a cupcake.
His stomach already felt full, but he had a feeling this morning
might use a lot of calories.
</p>
<p>
 As he ate his cupcake, Harry thought of the worst teacher he'd
met so far, Professor Binns of History. Professor Binns was a
ghost. From what Hermione had said about ghosts, it didn't seem
likely that they were fully self-aware. There were no famous
discoveries made by ghosts, or much of any original work, no matter
who they'd been in life. Ghosts tended to have trouble remembering
the current century. Hermione had said they were like accidental
portraits, impressed into the surrounding matter by a burst of
psychic energy accompanying a wizard's sudden death.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had run into some stupid teachers during his abortive
forays into standard Muggle education - his father had been a lot
pickier when it came to selecting grad students as tutors, of
course - but History class was the first time he'd encountered a
teacher who literally wasn't sentient.
</p>
<p>
 And it showed, too. Harry had given up after five minutes and
started reading a textbook. When it became clear that "Professor
Binns" wasn't going to object, Harry had also reached into his
pouch and gotten earplugs.
</p>
<p>
 Did ghosts not require a salary? Was that it? Or was it
literally impossible to fire anyone in Hogwarts
 <em>
  even if they
died?
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Now it seemed that Professor Snape was going about being
absolutely awful to everyone who wasn't a Slytherin and it hadn't
even
 <em>
  occurred
 </em>
 to anyone to terminate his contract.
</p>
<p>
 And the Headmaster had set fire to a chicken.
</p>
<p>
 "Excuse me," came a worried voice from behind him.
</p>
<p>
 "I swear," Harry said without turning around, "this place is
almost eight and a half percent as bad as what Dad says about
Oxford."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">%</p>
<p>
 Harry stamped down the stone corridors, looking affronted,
annoyed, and infuriated all at once.
</p>
<p>
 "Dungeons!" Harry hissed. "
 <em>
  Dungeons!
 </em>
 These are not
dungeons! This is a basement! A
 <em>
  basement!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Some of the Ravenclaw girls gave him odd looks. The boys were
all used to him by now.
</p>
<p>
 It seemed that the level in which the Potions classroom was
located was called the "dungeons" for no better reason than that it
was below ground and slightly colder than the main castle.
</p>
<p>
 In
 <em>
  Hogwarts!
 </em>
 In
 <em>
  Hogwarts!
 </em>
 Harry had been
waiting his whole life and now he was
 <em>
  still
 </em>
 waiting and if
there was anywhere
 <em>
  on the face of the Earth
 </em>
 that had
decent dungeons it ought to be Hogwarts! Was Harry going to have to
build his own castle if he wanted to see one little bottomless
abyss?
</p>
<p>
 A short time later they got to the actual Potions classroom and
Harry cheered up considerably.
</p>
<p>
 The Potions classroom had strange preserved creatures floating
in huge jars on shelves that covered every centimeter of wall space
between the closets. Harry had gotten far enough along in his
reading now that he could actually identify some of the creatures,
like the Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit the fifty-centimeter spider
 <em>
  looked
 </em>
 like an Acromantula but it was too small to
 <em>
  be
 </em>
 one. He'd tried asking Hermione, but she hadn't seemed
very interested in looking anywhere near where he was pointing.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was looking at a large dust ball with eyes and feet when
the assassin swept into the room.
</p>
<p>
 That was the first thought that crossed Harry's mind when he saw
Professor Severus Snape. There was something quiet and deadly about
the way the man stalked between the children's desks. His robes
were unkempt, his hair spotted and greasy. There was something
about him that seemed reminiscent of Lucius, although the two of
them looked nothing remotely alike, and you got the impression that
where Lucius would kill you with flawless elegance, this man would
simply kill you.
</p>
<p>
 "Sit down," said Professor Severus Snape. "Now."
</p>
<p>
 Harry and a few other children who had been standing around
talking to each other scrambled for desks. Harry had planned on
ending up next to Hermione but somehow he found himself sitting
down in the nearest empty desk next to Justin Finch-Fletchley (it
was a Doubles session, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff) which put him two
desks to the left of Hermione.
</p>
<p>
 Severus seated himself behind the teacher's desk, and without
the slightest transition or introduction, said, "Hannah
Abbott."
</p>
<p>
 "Here," said Hannah in a somewhat trembling voice.
</p>
<p>
 "Susan Bones."
</p>
<p>
 "Present."
</p>
<p>
 And so it went, no one daring to say a word in edgewise,
until:
</p>
<p>
 "Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new...
 <em>
  celebrity.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "The celebrity is present,
 <em>
  sir
 </em>
 ."
</p>
<p>
 Half the class flinched, and some of the smarter ones suddenly
looked like they wanted to run out the door while the classroom was
still there.
</p>
<p>
 Severus smiled in an anticipatory sort of way and called the
next name on his list.
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave a mental sigh. That had happened way too fast for him
to do anything about it. Oh well. Clearly this man already didn't
like him, for whatever reason. And when Harry thought about it,
better by far that this Potions professor should pick on
 <em>
  him
 </em>
 rather than, say, Neville or Hermione. Harry was a lot
better able to defend himself. Yep, probably all for the best.
</p>
<p>
 When full attendance had been taken, Severus swept his gaze over
the full class. His eyes were as empty as a night sky without
stars.
</p>
<p>
 "You are here," Severus said in a quiet voice which the students
at back strained to hear, "to learn the subtle science and exact
art of potionmaking. As there is little foolish wand-waving here,
many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron
with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep
through human veins," this in a rather caressing, gloating tone,
"bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses," this was just getting
creepier and creepier. "I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew
glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as great a pack of fools
as I usually have to teach."
</p>
<p>
 Severus somehow seemed to notice the look of skepticism on
Harry's face, or at least his eyes suddenly jumped to where Harry
was sitting.
</p>
<p>
 "Potter!" snapped the Potions professor. "What would I get if I
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry blinked. "Was that in
 <em>
  Magical Drafts and
Potions
 </em>
 ?" he said. "I just finished reading it, and I don't
remember anything which used wormwood -"
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's hand went up and Harry shot her a glare which caused
her to raise her hand even higher.
</p>
<p>
 "Tut, tut," Severus said silkily. "Fame clearly isn't
everything."
</p>
<p>
 "Really?" Harry said. "But you just told us you'd teach us how
to bottle fame. Say, how
 <em>
  does
 </em>
 that work, exactly? You
drink it and turn into a celebrity?"
</p>
<p>
 Three-quarters of the class flinched.
</p>
<p>
 Hermione's hand was dropping slowly back down. Well, that wasn't
surprising. She might be his rival, but she wasn't the sort of girl
who would play along after it became clear that the professor was
deliberately trying to humiliate him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was trying hard to keep control of his temper. The first
rejoinder that had crossed his mind was 'Abracadabra'.
</p>
<p>
 "Let's try again," said Severus. "Potter, where would you look
if I told you to find me a bezoar?"
</p>
<p>
 "That's not in the textbook either," Harry said, "but in one
Muggle book I read that a trichinobezoar is a mass of solidified
hair found in a human stomach, and Muggles used to believe it would
cure any poison -"
</p>
<p>
 "Wrong," Severus said. "A bezoar is found in the stomach of a
goat, it is not made of hair, and it will cure most poisons but not
all."
</p>
<p>
 "I didn't
 <em>
  say
 </em>
 it would, I said that was what I read in
one Muggle book -"
</p>
<p>
 "No one here is interested in your
 <em>
  pathetic
 </em>
 Muggle
books. Final try. What is the difference, Potter, between
monksblood and wolfsbane?"
</p>
<p>
 That did it.
</p>
<p>
 "You know," Harry said icily, "in one of my quite
 <em>
  fascinating
 </em>
 Muggle books, they describe a study in which
people managed to make themselves look very smart by asking
questions about random facts that only they knew. Apparently the
onlookers only noticed that the askers knew and the answerers
didn't, and failed to adjust for the unfairness of the underlying
game. So, Professor, can you tell me how many electrons are in the
outermost orbital of a carbon atom?"
</p>
<p>
 Severus's smile widened. "Four," he said. "It is a useless fact
which no one should bother writing down, however. And for your
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion
so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. As for
monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes
by the name of aconite, as you would know if you had read
 <em>
  One
Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.
 </em>
 Thought you didn't need to
open the book before coming, eh, Potter? All the rest of you should
be copying that down so that you will not be as ignorant as him."
Severus paused, looking quite pleased with himself. "And that will
be... five points? No, let us make it an even ten points from
Ravenclaw for backchat."
</p>
<p>
 Hermione gasped, along with a number of others.
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Severus Snape," Harry bit out. "I know of nothing
which I have done to earn your enmity. If there is some problem you
have with me which I do not know about, I suggest we -"
</p>
<p>
 "Shut up, Potter. Ten more points from Ravenclaw. The rest of
you, open your books to page 3."
</p>
<p>
 There was only a slight, only a very faint burning sensation in
the back of Harry's throat, and no moisture at all in his eyes. If
crying was not an effective strategy for destroying this Potions
professor then there was no point in crying.
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, Harry sat up very straight. All his blood seemed to have
been drained away and replaced with liquid nitrogen. He knew he'd
been trying to keep his temper but he couldn't seem to remember
why.
</p>
<p>
 "Harry," whispered Hermione frantically from two desks over,
"stop, please, it's all right, we won't count it -"
</p>
<p>
 "Talking in class, Granger? Three -"
</p>
<p>
 "So," said a voice colder than zero Kelvin, "how does one go
about filing a formal complaint against an abusive professor? Does
one talk to the Deputy Headmistress, write a letter to the Board of
Governors... would you care to explain how it works?"
</p>
<p>
 The class was utterly frozen.
</p>
<p>
 "Detention for one month, Potter," Severus said, smiling even
more broadly.
</p>
<p>
 "I decline to recognize your authority as a teacher and I will
not serve any detention you give."
</p>
<p>
 People stopped breathing.
</p>
<p>
 Severus's smile vanished. "Then you will be -" his voice stopped
short.
</p>
<p>
 "Expelled, were you about to say?" Harry, on the other hand, was
now smiling thinly. "But then you seemed to doubt your ability to
carry out the threat, or fear the consequences if you did. I, on
the other hand, neither doubt nor fear the prospect of finding a
school with less abusive professors. Or perhaps I should hire
private tutors, as is my accustomed practice, and be taught at my
full learning speed. I have enough money in my vault. Something
about bounties on a Dark Lord I defeated. But there
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 teachers at Hogwarts who I rather like, so I think it will be
easier if I find some way to get rid of you instead."
</p>
<p>
 "Get rid of me?" Severus said, now also smiling thinly. "What an
amusing conceit. How do you suppose you will do that, Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 "I understand there have been a number of complaints about you
from students and their parents," a guess but a safe one, "which
leaves only the question of why you're not already gone. Is
Hogwarts too financially strapped to afford a real Potions
professor? I could chip in, if so. I'm sure they could find a
better class of teacher if they offered double your current
salary."
</p>
<p>
 Two poles of ice radiated freezing winter across the
classroom.
</p>
<p>
 "You will find," Severus said softly, "that the Board of
Governers is not the slightest bit sympathetic to your offer."
</p>
<p>
 "Lucius..." Harry said. "
 <em>
  That's
 </em>
 why you're still here.
Perhaps I should chat with Lucius about that. I believe he desires
to meet with me. I wonder if I have anything he wants?"
</p>
<p>
 Hermione frantically shook her head. Harry noticed out of the
corner of his eye, but his attention was all on Severus.
</p>
<p>
 "You are a very foolish boy," Severus said. He wasn't smiling at
all, now. "You have nothing that Lucius values more than my
friendship. And if you did, I have other allies." His voice grew
hard. "And I find it increasingly unlikely that you were not Sorted
into Slytherin. How was it that you managed to stay out of my
House? Ah, yes, because the Sorting Hat claimed it was
 <em>
  joking
 </em>
 . For the first time in recorded history. What were
you really
 <em>
  chatting
 </em>
 about with the Sorting Hat, Potter?
Did you have something that it wanted?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared into Severus's cold gaze and remembered that the
Sorting Hat had warned him not to meet anyone's eyes while thinking
about - Harry dropped his gaze to Severus's desk.
</p>
<p>
 "You seem oddly reluctant to look me in the eyes, Potter!"
</p>
<p>
 A shock of sudden understanding - "So it was
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 the
Sorting Hat was warning me about!"
</p>
<p>
 "What?" said Severus's voice, sounding genuinely surprised,
though of course Harry didn't look at his face.
</p>
<p>
 Harry got up out of his desk.
</p>
<p>
 "Sit down, Potter," said an angry voice from somewhere he wasn't
looking.
</p>
<p>
 Harry ignored it, and looked around the classroom. "I have no
intention of letting one unprofessional teacher ruin my time at
Hogwarts," Harry said with deadly calm. "I think I'll take my leave
of this class, and either hire a tutor to teach me Potions while
I'm here, or if the Board is really that locked up, learn over the
summer. If any of you decide that you don't care to be bullied by
this man, my sessions will be open to you."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Sit down, Potter!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry strode across the room and grasped the doorknob.
</p>
<p>
 It didn't turn.
</p>
<p>
 Harry slowly turned around, and caught a glimpse of Severus
smiling nastily before he remembered to look away.
</p>
<p>
 "Open this door."
</p>
<p>
 "No," said Severus.
</p>
<p>
 "You are making me feel threatened," said a voice so icy it
didn't sound like Harry's at all, "and that is a mistake."
</p>
<p>
 Severus's voice laughed. "What do you intend to do about it,
little boy?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry took six long strides forward away from the door, until he
was standing near the back row of desks.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry drew himself upright and raised his right hand in one
terrible motion, fingers poised to snap.
</p>
<p>
 Neville screamed and dived under his desk. Other children shrank
back or instinctively raised their arms to shield themselves.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Harry don't!
 </em>
 " shrieked Hermione. "Whatever you were
going to do to him, don't do it!"
</p>
<p>
 "Have you all gone
 <em>
  mad?
 </em>
 " barked Severus's voice.
</p>
<p>
 Slowly, Harry lowered his hand. "I wasn't going to hurt him,
Hermione," Harry said, his voice a little lower. "I was just going
to blow up the door."
</p>
<p>
 Though now that Harry remembered it, you weren't supposed to
Transfigure things that were to be burned, which meant that going
back in time afterward and getting Fred or George to Transfigure
some carefully measured amount of explosives might not actually
have been such a good idea...
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Silencio,
 </em>
 " said Severus's voice.
</p>
<p>
 Harry tried to say "What?" and found that no sound was coming
out.
</p>
<p>
 "This has become ridiculous. I think you've been allowed to get
yourself in enough trouble for one day, Potter. You are the most
disruptive and unruly student I have ever seen, and I don't recall
how many points Ravenclaw has right now, but I'm sure I can manage
to wipe them all out. Ten points from Ravenclaw. Ten points from
Ravenclaw. Ten points from Ravenclaw! Fifty points from Ravenclaw!
Now sit down and watch the rest of the class take their
lesson!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry put his hand into his pouch and tried to say 'marker' but
of course no words came out. For one brief moment that stopped him;
and then it occurred to Harry to spell out M-A-R-K-E-R using finger
motions, which worked. P-A-D and he had a pad of paper. Harry
strode over to an empty desk, not the one he'd originally sat down
in, and scrawled a brief message. He tore off that sheet of paper,
put away the marker and pad in a pocket of his robes for quicker
access, and held up his message, not to Snape, but to the rest of
the class.
</p>
<p>
 I'M LEAVING
 <br/>
 DOES ANYONE ELSE
 <br/>
 NEED TO GET OUT?
</p>
<p>
 "You're insane, Potter," Severus said with cold contempt.
</p>
<p>
 Aside from that, no one spoke.
</p>
<p>
 Harry swept an ironic bow to the teacher's desk, walked over to
the wall, and with one smooth motion yanked open a closet door,
stepped in, and slammed the door shut behind him.
</p>
<p>
 There was the muffled sound of someone snapping his fingers, and
then nothing.
</p>
<p>
 In the classroom, students looked at each other in puzzlement
and fear.
</p>
<p>
 The Potions Master's face was now completely enraged. He crossed
the room in terrible strides and yanked open the closet door.
</p>
<p>
 The closet was empty.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">*</p>
<p>
 One hour earlier, Harry listened from inside the closed closet.
There was no sound from outside, and no point in taking risks
either.
</p>
<p>
 C-L-O-A-K, his fingers spelled out.
</p>
<p>
 Once he was invisible, he very carefully and slowly cracked open
the closet door and peeked out. No one seemed to be in the
classroom.
</p>
<p>
 The door wasn't locked.
</p>
<p>
 It was when Harry was outside the dangerous place and inside the
hallway, safely invisible, that some of the anger drained away and
he realized what he'd just done.
</p>
<p>
 What he'd just done.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's invisible face was frozen in absolute horror.
</p>
<p>
 He'd antagonized a teacher three orders of magnitude beyond
anything he'd ever managed before. He'd threatened to walk out of
Hogwarts and might have to follow through on it. He'd lost all the
points Ravenclaw had and then he'd used the Time-Turner...
</p>
<p>
 His imagination showed him his parents yelling at him after he
was expelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed in him, and it was
just too painful and he couldn't bear it and he
 <em>
  couldn't think
of any way to save himself -
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The thought that Harry allowed himself to think was that if
getting angry had gotten him into all this trouble, then maybe when
he was angry he'd think of a way out, things seemed clearer somehow
when he was angry.
</p>
<p>
 And the thought that Harry didn't let himself think was that he
just couldn't face this future if he wasn't angry.
</p>
<p>
 So he cast his thoughts back and remembered the burning
humiliation -
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Tut, tut. Fame clearly isn't everything.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Ten points from Ravenclaw for backchat.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The calming cold washed back through his veins like a wave
reflected and returning from some breaker, and Harry let out his
breath.
</p>
<p>
 Okay. Back to being sane now.
</p>
<p>
 He was actually feeling a bit disappointed in his non-angry self
for collapsing like that and wanting only to get out of trouble.
Professor Severus Snape was
 <em>
  everyone's
 </em>
 problem.
Normal-Harry had forgotten that and wished for a way to protect
 <em>
  himself.
 </em>
 And let all the other victims go hang? The
question wasn't how to protect himself, the question was how to
destroy this Potions professor.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  So this is my dark side, is it?
 </em>
 <em>
  Bit of a prejudiced
term that, my light side seems more selfish and cowardly, not to
mention confused and panicky.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And now that he was thinking clearly, it was equally clear what
to do next. He'd already given himself an extra hour to prepare,
and could get up to five hours more if required...
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 Minerva McGonagall waited in the Headmaster's office.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore sat in his padded throne behind his desk, dressed in
four layers of formal lavender robes. Minerva sat in a chair before
him, opposite Severus in another chair. Facing the three of them
was an empty wooden stool.
</p>
<p>
 They were waiting for Harry Potter.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Harry,
 </em>
 Minerva thought despairingly,
 <em>
  you promised
you wouldn't bite any teachers!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 And in her mind she could see very clearly the reply, Harry's
angry face and his outraged response:
 <em>
  I said I wouldn't bite
anyone who didn't bite me first!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 There was a knock at the door.
</p>
<p>
 "Come in!" Dumbledore called.
</p>
<p>
 The door swept open, and Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost
gasped out loud. The boy looked cool, collected, and utterly in
control of himself.
</p>
<p>
 "Good mor-" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, and she saw that Harry was staring
at Fawkes where the phoenix sat on its golden perch. Fawkes
fluttered his bright red-golden wings like the flickering of a
flame, and dipped his head in a measured nod to the boy.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned to stare at Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore winked at him.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva felt she was missing something.
</p>
<p>
 Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered.
Fear showed in his eyes, then anger, and then the boy was calm
again.
</p>
<p>
 A chill went down Minerva's spine. Something was not right
here.
</p>
<p>
 "Please sit down," said Dumbledore. His face was now serious
once more.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sat.
</p>
<p>
 "So, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I've heard one report of this day
from Professor Snape. Would you care to tell me what happened in
your own words?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry's gaze flicked dismissively to Severus. "It's not
complicated," said the boy, smiling thinly. "He tried bullying me
the way he's been bullying every non-Slytherin in the school since
the day Lucius foisted him off on you. As for the other details, I
request a private conversation with you concerning them. A student
who is reporting abusive behavior from a professor can hardly be
expected to speak frankly in front of that same professor, after
all."
</p>
<p>
 This time Minerva couldn't stop herself from gasping out
loud.
</p>
<p>
 Severus simply laughed.
</p>
<p>
 And the Headmaster's face grew grave. "Mr. Potter," the
Headmaster said, "one does not speak of a Hogwarts professor in
such terms. I fear that you labor under a terrible misapprehension.
Professor Severus Snape has my fullest confidence, and serves
Hogwarts at my own behest, not Lucius Malfoy's."
</p>
<p>
 There was silence for a few moments.
</p>
<p>
 When the boy spoke again his voice was icy. "Am I missing
something here?"
</p>
<p>
 "Quite a number of things, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster.
"You should understand, to start with, that the purpose of this
meeting is to discuss how to discipline you for the events of this
morning."
</p>
<p>
 "This man has terrorized your school for years. I spoke to
students and collected stories to make sure there would be enough
for a newspaper campaign to rally the parents against him. Some of
the younger students cried while they told me. I almost cried when
I heard them!
 <em>
  You allowed this abuser to run free? You did this
to your students? Why?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Minerva swallowed a lump in her throat. She'd - thought that,
sometimes, but somehow she'd never quite -
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, his voice now stern, "this
meeting is not about Professor Snape. It is about you and your
disregard for school discipline. Professor Snape has suggested, and
I have agreed, that three full months of detention will be
appropriate -"
</p>
<p>
 "Declined," Harry said icily.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva was speechless.
</p>
<p>
 "This is not a request, Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said. The
full, entire force of the wizard's gaze was turned on the boy.
"This is your punishme-"
</p>
<p>
 "You will explain to me why you allowed this man to hurt the
children placed in your care, and if your explanation is not
sufficient then I will begin my newspaper campaign with
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 as the target."
</p>
<p>
 Minerva's body swayed with the force of that blow, with the
sheer raw
 <em>
  lese majeste
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Even Severus looked shocked.
</p>
<p>
 "That, Harry, would be most extremely unwise," Dumbledore said
slowly. "I am the primary piece opposing Lucius on the gameboard.
For you to do such a thing would strengthen him greatly, and I did
not think that was your chosen side."
</p>
<p>
 The boy was still for a long moment.
</p>
<p>
 "This conversation grows private," Harry said. His hand flicked
in Severus's direction. "Send him away."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore shook his head. "Harry, did I not tell you that
Severus Snape has my fullest confidence?"
</p>
<p>
 The boy's face showed the shock of it. "This man's bullying
makes you vulnerable! I am not the only one who could start a
newspaper campaign against you! This is insane! Why are you doing
this?"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore sighed. "I'm sorry, Harry. It has to do with things
that you are not, at this time, ready to hear."
</p>
<p>
 The boy stared at Dumbledore. Then he turned to look at Severus.
Then back to Dumbledore again.
</p>
<p>
 "It
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 insanity," the boy said slowly. "You haven't
reined him in because you think he's
 <em>
  part of the pattern
 </em>
 .
That Hogwarts needs an evil Potions Master to be a proper magical
school, just as it needs a ghost to teach History."
</p>
<p>
 "That does sound like the sort of thing I would do, doesn't it?"
said Dumbledore, smiling.
</p>
<p>
 "Unacceptable," Harry said flatly. His gaze was now cold and
dark. "I will not tolerate bullying or abuse. I had considered many
possible ways of dealing with this problem, but I will make it
simple. Either this man goes, or I do."
</p>
<p>
 Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered in Severus's
eyes.
</p>
<p>
 Now Dumbledore's gaze was also growing cold. "Expulsion, Mr.
Potter, is the final threat which may be used against a student. It
is not customarily used as a threat by students against the
Headmaster. This is the best magical school in the entire world,
and an education here is not an opportunity given to everyone. Are
you under the impression that Hogwarts cannot get along without
you?"
</p>
<p>
 And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.
</p>
<p>
 Sudden horror dawned on Minerva. Surely Harry wouldn't -
</p>
<p>
 "You forget," Harry said, "that you're not the only one who can
see patterns.
 <em>
  This grows private. Now send him
 </em>
 -" Harry
flicked a hand at Severus again, and then stopped in mid-sentence
and mid-gesture.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva could see it on Harry's face, the moment when he
remembered.
</p>
<p>
 She'd told him, after all.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster, "once again, Severus Snape
has my fullest confidence."
</p>
<p>
 "You told him," whispered the boy. "You utter fool."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore didn't react to the insult. "Told him what?"
</p>
<p>
 "That the Dark Lord is alive."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What in Merlin's name are you on about, Potter?
 </em>
 "
cried Severus in tones of sheer astonishment and outrage.
</p>
<p>
 Harry glanced briefly at him, smiling grimly. "Oh, so we
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 a Slytherin, then," Harry said. "I was starting to
wonder."
</p>
<p>
 And then there was silence.
</p>
<p>
 Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice was mild. "Harry, what
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 you talking about?"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry, Albus," Minerva whispered.
</p>
<p>
 Severus and Dumbledore turned to look at her.
</p>
<p>
 "Professor McGonagall didn't tell me," said Harry's voice,
swiftly and less calm than it had been. "I guessed. I told you, I
can see the patterns too. I guessed, and she controlled her
reaction just as Severus did. But her control fell a shade short of
perfection, and I could tell it was control, not genuine."
</p>
<p>
 "And I told him," said Minerva, her voice trembling a little,
"that you, and I, and Severus were the only ones who knew."
</p>
<p>
 "Which she did as a concession to prevent me from simply going
around asking questions, as I threatened to do if she didn't talk,"
Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. "I really should have gotten
one of you alone and told you that she told me everything, to see
if you let anything slip. Probably wouldn't have worked, but would
have been worth a shot." The boy smiled again. "Threat's still on
the table and I do expect to be briefed
 <em>
  fully
 </em>
 at some
point."
</p>
<p>
 Severus was giving her a look of utter contempt. Minerva raised
her chin and bore it. She knew it was deserved.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore leaned back in his padded throne. His eyes were as
cold as anything Minerva had seen from him since the day his
brother died. "And you threaten to abandon us to Voldemort if we do
not comply with your wishes."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's voice was razor-sharp. "I regret to inform you that you
are not the center of the universe. I'm not threatening to walk out
on magical Britain. I'm threatening to walk out on
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 . I
am not a meek little Frodo. This is
 <em>
  my
 </em>
 quest and if you
want in you will play by
 <em>
  my
 </em>
 rules."
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore's face was still cold. "I am beginning to doubt your
suitability as the hero, Mr. Potter."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's return gaze was equally icy. "I am beginning to doubt
your suitability as my Gandalf,
 <em>
  Mr. Dumbledore
 </em>
 . Boromir
was at least a plausible mistake. What is this
 <em>
  Nazgul
 </em>
 doing in my Fellowship?"
</p>
<p>
 Minerva was completely lost. She looked at Severus, to see if he
was following this, and she saw that Severus had turned his face
away from Harry's field of vision and was smiling.
</p>
<p>
 "I suppose," Dumbledore said slowly, "that from your perspective
it is a reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, if Professor Snape is
to leave you alone henceforth, will that be the last time this
issue arises, or will I find you here every week with a new
demand?"
</p>
<p>
 "Leave
 <em>
  me
 </em>
 alone?" Harry's voice was outraged. "I am not
his only victim and certainly not the most vulnerable!
 <em>
  Have you
forgotten how defenseless children are? How much they hurt?
 </em>
 Henceforth Severus will treat
 <em>
  every
 </em>
 student of Hogwarts
with appropriate and professional courtesy, or you will find
another Potions Master, or you will find another hero!"
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous
laughter, as if Harry had just performed a comic dance in front of
him.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva didn't dare move. Her eyes flickered and she saw that
Severus was equally motionless.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's visage grew even colder. "You mistake me, Headmaster, if
you think that this is a joke. This is not a request. This is your
punishment."
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter -" Minerva said. She didn't even know what she was
going to say. She simply couldn't let that go by.
</p>
<p>
 Harry made a shushing gesture at her and continued to speak to
Dumbledore. "And if that seems impolite to you," Harry said, his
voice now a little less hard, "it seemed no less impolite when you
said it to me. You would not say such a thing to anyone who you
considered a real human being instead of a subordinate child, and I
will treat you with just the same courtesy as you treat me -"
</p>
<p>
 "Oh, indeed, in very deed, this is my punishment if ever there
was one! Of
 <em>
  course
 </em>
 you're in here blackmailing me to save
your fellow students, not to save yourself! I can't imagine why I
would have thought otherwise!" Dumbledore was now laughing even
harder. He pounded his fist on the desk three times.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her,
addressing her for the first time. "Excuse me," Harry said. His
voice seemed to be wavering. "Does he need to take his medication
or something?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." Minerva had no idea what she could possibly say.
</p>
<p>
 "Well," said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears that had formed in
his eyes. "Pardon me. I'm sorry for the interruption. Please
continue with the blackmail."
</p>
<p>
 Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He now seemed a
little unsteady. "Ah... he's also to stop reading students'
minds."
</p>
<p>
 "Minerva," Severus said, his voice deadly, "you -"
</p>
<p>
 "Sorting Hat warned me," said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm
done."
</p>
<p>
 Silence.
</p>
<p>
 "Now what?" Minerva said, when it became apparent that no one
else was going to say anything.
</p>
<p>
 "Now what?" Dumbledore echoed. "Why, now the hero wins, of
course."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
 " said Severus, Minerva, and Harry.
</p>
<p>
 "Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner,"
Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts
 <em>
  does
 </em>
 need
an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical
school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful
toward students in their fifth year and higher?"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What?
 </em>
 " said all three of them again.
</p>
<p>
 "If it's the most vulnerable victims about whom you're
concerned. Maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe I
 <em>
  have
 </em>
 forgotten over the decades what it's like to be a child. So let's
compromise. Severus will continue to unfairly award points to
Slytherin and impose lax discipline on his House, and he will be
awful to non-Slytherin students in their fifth year and higher. To
others he will be scary, but not abusive. He will promise to only
read minds when the safety of a student requires it. Hogwarts will
have its evil Potions Master, and the most vulnerable victims, as
you put it, will be safe."
</p>
<p>
 Minerva McGonagall was as shocked as she'd ever been in her
life. She glanced uncertainly at Severus, whose face had been left
completely neutral, as though he couldn't decide what sort of
expression he ought to be wearing.
</p>
<p>
 "I suppose that is acceptable," Harry said. His voice sounded a
bit odd.
</p>
<p>
 "You can't be serious," Severus said, his voice as
expressionless as his face.
</p>
<p>
 "I am very much in favor of this," Minerva said slowly. She was
so much in favor that her heart was pounding wildly beneath her
robes. "But what could we possibly tell the students? They might
not have questioned this while Severus was... being awful to
everyone, but -"
</p>
<p>
 "Harry can tell the other students that he discovered a terrible
secret of Severus's and did a bit of blackmail," said Dumbledore.
"It's true, after all; he discovered that Severus was reading
minds, and he certainly did blackmail us."
</p>
<p>
 "This is insanity!" exploded Severus.
</p>
<p>
 "Bwah ha ha!" said Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah..." said Harry uncertainly. "And if anyone asks me why fifth
years and above got shafted? I wouldn't blame them for being irate,
and that part wasn't exactly my idea -"
</p>
<p>
 "Tell them," said Dumbledore, "that it wasn't you who suggested
the compromise, that it was all you could get. And then refuse to
say anything more. That, too, is true. There's an art to it, you'll
pick it up with practice."
</p>
<p>
 Harry nodded slowly. "And the points he took from
Ravenclaw?"
</p>
<p>
 "They must not be given back."
</p>
<p>
 It was Minerva who said it.
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked at her.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," she said. She
 <em>
  was
 </em>
 sorry, but
it had to be done. "There
 <em>
  must
 </em>
 be some consequences for
your misbehavior or this school will fall to pieces."
</p>
<p>
 Harry shrugged. "Acceptable," he said flatly. "But in the future
Severus will not strike at my House connections by taking points
from me, nor will he waste my valuable time with detentions. Should
he feel that my behavior requires correction, he may communicate
his concerns to Professor McGonagall."
</p>
<p>
 "Harry," Minerva said, "will you continue to submit to school
discipline, or are you to be above the law now, as Severus
was?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry looked at her. Something warm touched his gaze, briefly
before it was quashed. "I will continue to be an ordinary student
to every member of the staff who is not insane or evil, provided
that they do not come under pressure from others who are." Harry
glanced briefly at Severus, then turned back to Dumbledore. "Leave
Minerva alone, and I'll be a regular Hogwarts student in her
presence. No special privileges or immunities."
</p>
<p>
 "Beautiful," Dumbledore said sincerely. "Spoken like a true
hero."
</p>
<p>
 "And," she said, "Mr. Potter must publicly apologize for his
actions of today."
</p>
<p>
 Harry gave her another look. This one was a bit skeptical.
</p>
<p>
 "The discipline of the school has been gravely injured by your
actions, Mr. Potter," Minerva said. "It must be restored."
</p>
<p>
 "I think, Professor McGonagall, that you considerably
overestimate the importance of what you call school discipline, as
compared to having History taught by a live teacher or not
torturing your students. Maintaining the current status hierarchy
and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and
important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when
you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if
required. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I
will leave it at that."
</p>
<p>
 Minerva shook her head. "Mr. Potter, you underestimate the
importance of discipline because you are not in need of it yourself
-" She paused. That hadn't come out right, and Severus, Dumbledore,
and even Harry were giving her strange looks. "To learn, I mean.
Not every child can learn in the absence of authority. And it is
the other children who will be hurt, Mr. Potter, if they see your
example as one to be followed."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's lips curved into a twisted smile. "The first and last
resort is the truth. The truth is that I shouldn't have gotten
angry, I shouldn't have disrupted the class, I shouldn't have done
what I did, and I set a bad example for everyone. The truth is also
that Severus Snape behaved in a fashion unbecoming a Hogwarts
professor, and that from now on he will be more mindful of the
injured feelings of students in their fourth year and under. The
two of us could both get up and speak the truth. I could live with
that."
</p>
<p>
 "In your dreams, Potter!" spat Severus.
</p>
<p>
 "After all," said Harry, smiling grimly, "if the students see
that rules are for
 <em>
  everyone...
 </em>
 for professors too, not
just for poor helpless students who get nothing but suffering out
of the system... why, the positive effects on school discipline
should be
 <em>
  tremendous.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 There was a brief pause, and then Dumbledore chuckled. "Minerva
is thinking that you're righter than you have any right to be."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's gaze jerked away from Dumbledore, down to the floor.
"Are
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 reading
 <em>
  her
 </em>
 mind?"
</p>
<p>
 "Common sense is often mistaken for Legilimency," said
Dumbledore. "I shall talk over this matter with Severus, and no
apology will be required from you unless he apologizes as well. And
now I declare this matter concluded, at least until lunchtime." He
paused. "Although, Harry, I'm afraid that Minerva wished to speak
with you about an additional matter. And that is not the result of
any pressure on my part. Minerva, if you would?"
</p>
<p>
 Minerva rose from her chair and almost fell. There was too much
adrenaline in her blood, her heart was beating too fast.
</p>
<p>
 "Fawkes," said Dumbledore, "accompany her, please."
</p>
<p>
 "I don't -" she started to say.
</p>
<p>
 Dumbledore shot her a look, and she fell silent.
</p>
<p>
 The phoenix soared across the room like a smooth tongue of flame
leaping out, and landed on her shoulder. She felt the warmth
through her robes, all through her body.
</p>
<p>
 "Please follow me, Mr. Potter," she said, firmly now, and they
left through the door.
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 They stood on the rotating stairs, descending in silence.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva didn't know what to say. She didn't know this person who
stood beside her.
</p>
<p>
 And Fawkes began to croon.
</p>
<p>
 It was tender, and soft, like a fireplace would sound if it had
melody, and it washed over Minerva's mind, easing, soothing,
gentling what it touched...
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  What
 </em>
 is
 <em>
  that?
 </em>
 " Harry whispered beside her.
His voice was unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.
</p>
<p>
 "The song of the phoenix," said Minerva, not really aware of
what she was saying, her attention was all on that strange quiet
music. "It, too, heals."
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned his face from her, but she caught a glimpse of
something agonized.
</p>
<p>
 The descent seemed to take a very long time, or maybe it was
only that the music seemed to take a very long time, and when they
stepped out through the gap where a gargoyle had been, she was
holding Harry's hand firmly in hers.
</p>
<p>
 As the gargoyle stepped back into place, Fawkes left her
shoulder, and swooped to hover in front of Harry.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stared at Fawkes like someone hypnotized by the
ever-changing light of a fire.
</p>
<p>
 "What am I to do, Fawkes?" whispered Harry. "I couldn't have
protected them if I hadn't been angry."
</p>
<p>
 The phoenix's wings continued flapping, it continued hovering in
place. There was no sound but the beating of the wings. Then there
was a flash like a fire flaring up and going out, and Fawkes was
gone.
</p>
<p>
 Both of them blinked, like waking up from a dream, or maybe like
falling asleep again.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva looked down.
</p>
<p>
 Harry Potter's bright young face looked up at her.
</p>
<p>
 "Are phoenixes people?" said Harry. "I mean, are they smart
enough to count as people? Could I talk with Fawkes if I knew
how?"
</p>
<p>
 Minerva blinked hard. Then she blinked again. "No," Minerva
said, her voice wavering. "Phoenixes are creatures of powerful
magic. That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which
no simple animal could possess. They are fire, light, healing,
rebirth. But in the end, no."
</p>
<p>
 "Where can I get one?"
</p>
<p>
 Minerva leaned down and hugged him. She hadn't meant to, but she
didn't seem to have much choice in the matter.
</p>
<p>
 When she stood up she found it hard to speak. But she had to
ask. "What happened today, Harry?"
</p>
<p>
 "I don't know the answers to any of the important questions
either. Aside from that I'd really rather not think about it for a
while."
</p>
<p>
 Minerva took his hand in hers again, and they walked the rest of
the way in silence.
</p>
<p>
 It was only a short trip, since naturally the office of the
Deputy was close to the office of the Headmaster.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva sat behind her desk.
</p>
<p>
 Harry sat in front of her desk.
</p>
<p>
 "So," Minerva whispered. She would have given almost anything
not to do this, or not to be the one who had to do it, or for it to
be any time but right now. "There is a matter of school discipline.
From which you are not exempt."
</p>
<p>
 "Namely?" said Harry.
</p>
<p>
 He didn't know. He hadn't figured it out yet. She felt her
throat tighten. But there was work to be done and she would not
shirk it.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I need to see your
Time-Turner, please."
</p>
<p>
 All the peace of the phoenix vanished from his face in an
instant and Minerva felt like she had just stabbed him.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  No!
 </em>
 " Harry said. His voice was panicked. "I need it,
I won't be able to attend Hogwarts, I won't be able to sleep!"
</p>
<p>
 "You'll be able to sleep," she said. "The Ministry has delivered
the protective shell for your Time-Turner. I will enchant it to
open only between the hours of 9PM and midnight."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's face twisted. "But - but I -"
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter, how many times have you used the Time-Turner since
Monday? How many hours?"
</p>
<p>
 "I..." Harry said. "Hold on, let me add it up -" He glanced down
at his watch.
</p>
<p>
 Minerva felt a rush of sadness. She'd thought so. "It wasn't
just two per day, then. I suspect that if I asked your dormmates, I
would find that you were struggling to stay up long enough to go to
sleep at a reasonable time, and waking up earlier and earlier every
morning. Correct?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry's face said everything she needed to know.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Potter," she said gently, "there are students who cannot be
entrusted with Time-Turners, because they become addicted to them.
We give them a potion which lengthens their sleep cycle by the
necessary amount, but they end up using the Time-Turner for more
than just attending their classes. And so we must take them back.
Mr. Potter, you have taken to using the Time-Turner as your
solution to everything, often very foolishly so. You used it to get
back a Remembrall. You vanished from a closet in a fashion apparent
to other students, instead of going back after you were out and
getting me or someone else to come and open the door."
</p>
<p>
 From the look on Harry's face he hadn't thought of that.
</p>
<p>
 "And more importantly," she said, "you should have simply sat in
Professor Snape's class. And watched. And left at the end of class.
As you would have done if you had not possessed a Time-Turner.
There are some students who cannot be entrusted with Time-Turners,
Mr. Potter. You are one of them. I am sorry."
</p>
<p>
 "But I
 <em>
  need
 </em>
 it!" Harry blurted. "What if there are
Slytherins threatening me and I have to escape? It keeps me
 <em>
  safe
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 "Every other student in this castle runs the same risk, and I
assure you that they survive. No student has died in this castle
for fifty years. Mr. Potter, you will hand over your Time-Turner
and do so now."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's face twisted in agony, but he drew out the Time-Turner
from under his robes and gave it to her.
</p>
<p>
 From her desk, Minerva drew out one of the protective shells
that had been sent to Hogwarts. She snapped the cover into place
around the Time-Turner's turning hourglass, and then she laid her
wand on the cover to complete the enchantment.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  This isn't fair!
 </em>
 " Harry shrieked. "I saved half of
Hogwarts from Professor Snape today, is it right that I be punished
for it? I saw the look on your face, you
 <em>
  hated
 </em>
 what he was
doing!"
</p>
<p>
 Minerva didn't speak for a few moments. She was enchanting.
</p>
<p>
 When she finished and looked up, she knew that her face was
stern. Maybe it was the wrong thing to do. And then again maybe it
was the right thing to do. There was an obstinate child in front of
her, and that
 <em>
  didn't
 </em>
 mean the universe was broken.
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Fair,
 </em>
 Mr. Potter?" she snapped. "I have had to file
 <em>
  two reports
 </em>
 with the Ministry on public use of a
Time-Turner in
 <em>
  two successive days!
 </em>
 Be
 <em>
  extremely
 </em>
 grateful you were allowed to retain the Time-Turner even in
restricted form! The Headmaster made a Floo call to plead with them
personally and if you were not the Boy-Who-Lived even that would
not have sufficed!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry gaped at her.
</p>
<p>
 She knew that he was seeing the angry face of Professor
McGonagall.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's eyes filled up with tears.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm, sorry," he whispered, voice now choked and broken. "I'm
sorry, to have, disappointed you..."
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry too, Mr. Potter," she said sternly, and handed him
the newly restricted Time-Turner. "You may go."
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned and fled from her office, sobbing. She heard his
feet pattering away down the hall, and then the sound cut off as
the door swung closed.
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry too, Harry," she whispered to the quiet room. "I'm
sorry too."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 Fifteen minutes into lunch hour.
</p>
<p>
 No one was speaking to Harry. Some of the Ravenclaws were
shooting him looks of anger, others of sympathy, a few of the
youngest students even had looks of admiration, but no one was
talking to him. Even Hermione hadn't tried to come over.
</p>
<p>
 Fred and George had gingerly stepped near. They hadn't said
anything. The offer was clear, and its optionality. Harry had told
them that he would come over when dessert started, no earlier. They
had nodded and quickly walked away.
</p>
<p>
 It was probably the utterly expressionless look on Harry's face
that was doing it.
</p>
<p>
 The others probably thought he was controlling anger, or dismay.
They knew, because they'd seen Flitwick come and get him, that he'd
been called to the Headmaster's office.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was trying not to smile, because if he smiled, he would
start laughing, and if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until
the nice people in white jackets came to haul him away.
</p>
<p>
 It was too much. It was just all too much. Harry had almost gone
over to the Dark Side, his dark side had done things that seemed in
retrospect insane, his dark side had won an impossible victory that
might have been real and might have been a pure whim of a crazy
Headmaster, his dark side had protected his friends. He just
couldn't handle it any more. He needed Fawkes to sing to him again.
He needed to use the Time-Turner to go off and take a quiet hour to
recover but that wasn't an option any more and the loss was like a
hole in his existence but he couldn't think about that because then
he might start laughing.
</p>
<p>
 Twenty minutes. All the students who were going to eat lunch had
arrived, almost none had departed.
</p>
<p>
 The tapping of a spoon rang through the Great Hall.
</p>
<p>
 "If I may have your attention please," Dumbledore said. "Harry
Potter has something he would like to share with us."
</p>
<p>
 Harry took a deep breath and got up. He walked over to the Head
Table, with every eye staring at him.
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned and looked out at the four tables.
</p>
<p>
 It was becoming harder and harder not to smile, but Harry kept
his face expressionless as he spoke his brief and memorized
speech.
</p>
<p>
 "The truth is sacred," Harry said tonelessly. "One of my most
treasured possessions is a button which reads 'Speak the truth,
even if your voice trembles'. This, then, is the truth. Remember
that. I am not saying it because I am being forced to say it, I am
saying it because it is true. What I did in Professor Snape's class
was foolish, stupid, childish, and an inexcusable violation of the
rules of Hogwarts. I disrupted the classroom and deprived my fellow
students of their irreplaceable learning time. All because I failed
to control my temper. I hope that not a single one of you will ever
follow my example. I certainly intend to try never to follow it
again."
</p>
<p>
 Many of the students gazing at Harry now had solemn, unhappy
looks upon their faces, such as one might see at a ceremony marking
the loss of a fallen champion. At the younger parts of the
Gryffindor table the look was almost universal.
</p>
<p>
 Until Harry raised his hand.
</p>
<p>
 He did not raise it high. That might have appeared preemptory.
He certainly did not raise it toward Severus. Harry simply raised
his hand to chest level, and softly snapped his fingers, a gesture
that was seen more than heard. It was possible that most of the
Head Table wouldn't see it at all.
</p>
<p>
 This seeming gesture of defiance won sudden smiles from the
younger students and Gryffindors, and coldly superior sneers from
Slytherin, and frowns and worried looks from all others.
</p>
<p>
 Harry kept his face expressionless. "Thank you," he said.
"That's all."
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you, Mr. Potter," said the Headmaster. "And now Professor
Snape has something to share with us as well."
</p>
<p>
 Severus smoothly stood up from his place at the Head Table. "It
has been brought to my attention," he said, "that my own actions
played a part in provoking the admittedly inexcusable anger of Mr.
Potter, and in the ensuing discussion I realized that I had
forgotten how easily injured are the feelings of the young and
immature -"
</p>
<p>
 There was the sound of many people emitting muffled chokes at
the same time.
</p>
<p>
 Severus continued as if he had not heard. "The Potions classroom
is a dangerous place, and I still feel that strict discipline is
necessary, but henceforth I will be more aware of the... emotional
fragility... of students in their fourth year and younger. My
deduction of points from Ravenclaw still stands, but I will revoke
Mr. Potter's detention. Thank you."
</p>
<p>
 There was a single clap from the direction of Gryffindor and
faster than lightning Severus's wand was in his hand and
"
 <em>
  Quietus!
 </em>
 " silenced the offender.
</p>
<p>
 "I will still demand discipline and respect in
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 my
classes," Severus said coldly, "and anyone who trifles with me will
regret it."
</p>
<p>
 He sat down.
</p>
<p>
 "Thank you too!" Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. "Carry
on!"
</p>
<p>
 And Harry, still expressionless, began to walk back to his seat
in Ravenclaw.
</p>
<p>
 There was an explosion of conversation. Two words were clearly
identifiable in the beginning. The first was an initial "What -"
beginning many different sentences such as "What just happened -"
and "What the hell -" The second was "
 <em>
  Scourgify!
 </em>
 " as
students cleaned up the dropped food and spit-out drinks from
themselves, the tablecloth, and each other.
</p>
<p>
 Some students were weeping openly. So was Professor Sprout.
</p>
<p>
 At the Gryffindor table, where a cake waited with fifty-one
unlit candles, Fred whispered, "I think we may be out of our league
here, George."
</p>
<p>
 And from that day onward, no matter what Hermione tried to tell
anyone, it would be an accepted legend of Hogwarts that Harry
Potter could make absolutely anything happen by snapping his
fingers.

<p>
 Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed
robes somehow looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned-out
than the same exact robes as worn by the two boys behind him.
</p>
<p>
 "Talk," said Draco.
</p>
<p>
 "Yeah! Talk!"
</p>
<p>
 "You heard da boss! Talk!"
</p>
<p>
 "You two, on the other hand,

</p>
<p>
 The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in
that vast auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er,
Battle Magic.
</p>
<p>
 The last session of classes on Friday.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and
that the brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize this was
perhaps not the best time to single out Harry for anything. Harry
had recovered a little, but...
</p>
<p>
 ...but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of
stress relief first.
</p>
<p>
 Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great
solemnity upon Draco and his minions.
</p>
<p>
 "You ask, what is our aim?" Harry declaimed. "I can answer in
one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of
all terrors - Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for
without victory there is no -"
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Talk about Snape,
 </em>
 " Draco hissed. "
 <em>
  What did you
do?
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more
serious look.
</p>
<p>
 "You saw it," Harry said. "Everyone saw it. I snapped my
fingers."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Harry! Stop teasing me!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 So he'd been promoted to
 <em>
  Harry
 </em>
 now. Interesting. And in
fact Harry was fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and
feel bad if he didn't respond somehow...
</p>
<p>
 Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the
minions.
</p>
<p>
 "They won't talk," said Draco.
</p>
<p>
 "Draco," Harry said, "I'm going to be one hundred percent honest
here and say that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with
Mr. Goyle's cunning."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle winced.
</p>
<p>
 "Me neither," said Draco. "I explained to him that I ended up
owing you a favor because of it." (Mr. Goyle winced again.) "But
there
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 a big difference between that sort of mistake and
being indiscreet. That really is something they've been trained
from childhood to understand."
</p>
<p>
 "All right then," Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though
the background noises had gone to blurs in Draco's presence. "I
deduced one of Severus's secrets and did a bit of blackmail."
</p>
<p>
 Draco's expression hardened. "Good, now tell me something you
didn't tell in strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor,
meaning that was the story you
 <em>
  wanted
 </em>
 to get all over the
school."
</p>
<p>
 Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught
it.
</p>
<p>
 "What is Severus saying?" Harry said.
</p>
<p>
 "That he hadn't realized how sensitive the feelings of young
children were," Draco said. "Even in Slytherin! Even to
 <em>
  me!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "Are you sure," Harry said, "that you want to know something
your Head of House would rather you not know?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Draco said without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Interesting.
 </em>
 "Then you really are going to send your
minions away first, because I'm not sure I can believe everything
you believe about them."
</p>
<p>
 Draco nodded. "Okay."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 unhappy. "Boss -"
said Mr. Crabbe.
</p>
<p>
 "You've given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you," Draco said.
"Go!"
</p>
<p>
 They left.
</p>
<p>
 "In particular," Harry said, lowering his voice even further,
"I'm not
 <em>
  entirely
 </em>
 sure that they wouldn't just report what
I said to Lucius."
</p>
<p>
 "Father wouldn't
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 that!" Draco said, looking
genuinely aghast. "They're
 <em>
  mine!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said. "I'm just not sure I can believe
everything you believe about your father. Imagine it was your
secret and me telling you my father wouldn't do that."
</p>
<p>
 Draco nodded slowly. "You're right.
 <em>
  I'm
 </em>
 sorry, Harry.
It was wrong of me to ask it of you."
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  How did I get
 </em>
 this
 <em>
  promoted? Shouldn't he hate me
now?
 </em>
 Harry had the feeling he was looking at something
exploitable... he just wished his brain wasn't so exhausted.
Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at some complicated
plotting.
</p>
<p>
 "Anyway," Harry said. "Trade. I tell you a fact that isn't on
the grapevine, and does not
 <em>
  go
 </em>
 on the grapevine, and in
 <em>
  particular
 </em>
 does not go to your father, and in return you
tell me what you and Slytherin think about the whole business."
</p>
<p>
 "Deal!"
</p>
<p>
 Now to make this as vague as possible... something that wouldn't
hurt much even if it did get out... "What I said was true. I did
discover one of Severus's secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But
Severus wasn't the only person involved."
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  I knew it!
 </em>
 " Draco said exultantly.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's stomach sank. He had apparently said something very
significant and he did not know why. This was not a good sign.
</p>
<p>
 "All right," Draco said. He was grinning widely now. "So here's
what the reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were
like, 'We hate Harry Potter! Let's go beat him up!'"
</p>
<p>
 Harry choked. "What is
 <em>
  wrong
 </em>
 with the Sorting Hat?
That's not Slytherin, it's
 <em>
  Gryffindor
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 "Not all children are prodigies," Draco said, though he was
smiling in a sort of nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest
that he privately agreed with Harry's opinion. "And it took around
fifteen seconds for someone to explain to them why this might not
be such a favor to Snape, so you're fine. Anyway, after that was
the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, 'Looks like
Harry Potter was just another do-gooder after all.'"
</p>
<p>
 "And then?" Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 was stupid.
</p>
<p>
 "And then the actual smart people started talking. It's obvious
that you found a way to put a
 <em>
  lot
 </em>
 of pressure on Snape.
And while that could be more than one thing... the obvious
 <em>
  next
 </em>
 thought is that it has something to do with Snape's
unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?"
</p>
<p>
 "No comment," Harry said. At least his brain was processing this
part correctly. House Slytherin
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 wondered why Severus
wasn't getting fired. And they'd concluded that Severus was
blackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually be true...? But
Dumbledore hadn't seemed to act like it...
</p>
<p>
 Draco went on talking. "And the
 <em>
  next
 </em>
 thing the smart
people pointed out was that if you could put enough pressure on
Snape to make him leave half of Hogwarts alone, that meant you
probably had enough power to get rid of him entirely, if you
wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same way he
tried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House."
</p>
<p>
 Harry made his smile wider.
</p>
<p>
 "And then the
 <em>
  really
 </em>
 smart people," Draco said, his
face now serious, "went off and had a little discussion by
themselves, and someone pointed out that it would be a very stupid
thing to leave an enemy around like that. If you could break his
hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it.
Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him
killed, he'd be
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 grateful to you, and you wouldn't
have to worry about Snape sneaking into your dorm room at night
with interesting potions."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he
really, really should have. "And from this you concluded...?"
</p>
<p>
 "Snape's hold was some secret of Dumbledore's and
 <em>
  you've got
the secret!
 </em>
 " Draco was looking exultant. "It can't be
powerful enough to destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have
used it by now. Snape refuses to use his hold for anything except
staying king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts, and he doesn't always
get what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But it's
 <em>
  got
 </em>
 to be really good! Father's been trying to get Snape
to tell him for
 <em>
  years!
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 "And," Harry said, "now Lucius thinks maybe
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 can tell
him. Did you already get an owl -"
</p>
<p>
 "I will tonight," Draco said, and laughed. "It will say," his
voice took on a different, more formal cadence, "
 <em>
  My beloved
son: I've already told you of Harry Potter's potential importance.
As you have already realized, his importance has now become greater
and more urgent. If you see any possible avenue of friendship or
point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the full
resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.
 </em>
 "
</p>
<p>
 Gosh. "Well," Harry said, "not commenting on whether or not your
whole complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that
we are not quite such good friends as yet."
</p>
<p>
 "I know," Draco said. Then his face turned
 <em>
  very
 </em>
 serious, and his voice grew quiet even within the blur. "Harry, has
it occurred to you that if you know something Dumbledore doesn't
want known, Dumbledore might simply have you killed? And it would
turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader into a
valuable martyr, too."
</p>
<p>
 "No comment," Harry said yet again. He hadn't thought of that
last part, either. Didn't
 <em>
  seem
 </em>
 to be Dumbledore's style...
but...
</p>
<p>
 "Harry," Draco said, "you've obviously got
 <em>
  incredible
 </em>
 talent, but you've got no training and no mentors and you do stupid
things sometimes and
 <em>
  you really need an advisor who knows how
to do this or you're going to get hurt!
 </em>
 " Draco's face was
fierce.
</p>
<p>
 "Ah," Harry said. "An advisor like Lucius?"
</p>
<p>
 "Like
 <em>
  me!
 </em>
 " said Draco. "I'll promise to keep your
secrets from Father, from
 <em>
  everyone,
 </em>
 I'll just help you
figure out whatever you want to do!"
</p>
<p>
 Wow.
</p>
<p>
 Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the
doors.
</p>
<p>
 "Class is about to start," said Harry. "I'll think about what
you said, there's lots of times I
 <em>
  do
 </em>
 wish I had all your
training, it's just I don't know how I can trust you so quickly
-"
</p>
<p>
 "You shouldn't," Draco said, "it's too soon. See? I'll give you
good advice even if it hurts me. But we should maybe
 <em>
  hurry
up
 </em>
 and become closer friends."
</p>
<p>
 "I'm open to that," said Harry, who was already trying to figure
out how to exploit it.
</p>
<p>
 "Another bit of advice," Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell
slouched toward his desk, "right now everyone in Slytherin's
wondering about you, so if you're courting us, which I think you
are, you should do something that signals friendship to Slytherin.
 <em>
  Soon
 </em>
 , like today or tomorrow."
</p>
<p>
 "Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin
wasn't enough?" No reason Harry couldn't take credit for it.
</p>
<p>
 Draco's eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly,
"It's not the same, trust me, it's got to be something obvious.
Push your mudblood rival Granger into a wall or something, everyone
in Slytherin will know what that means -"
</p>
<p>
 "That is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you
have to push someone into a wall it means your brain is too
 <em>
  weak
 </em>
 to beat them the right way and everyone in Ravenclaw
 <em>
  knows that
 </em>
 -"
</p>
<p>
 The screen on Harry's desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash
of nostalgia for television and computers.
</p>
<p>
 "Ahem," said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming to speak
personally to Harry out of the screen. "Please take your
seats."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">$</p>
<p>
 And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater
screens on their desks, or looking down directly at the great white
marble stage where Professor Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk
atop the small dais of darker marble.
</p>
<p>
 "Today," said Professor Quirrell, "I had planned to teach you
your first defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of
today's
 <em>
  Protego.
 </em>
 But on second thought I have changed
today's lesson plan in the light of recent events."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry
winced from where he was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling
he knew who was about to be called on.
</p>
<p>
 "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said
Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 Whew.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, Professor?" said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming
to come from the repeater screen on Harry's desk, which showed
Draco's face as he spoke. Then the screen shifted back to Professor
Quirrell, who said:
</p>
<p>
 "Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?"
</p>
<p>
 "That's an odd question, Professor," said Draco. "I mean, who'd
be dumb enough to admit it?"
</p>
<p>
 A few students laughed, but not many.
</p>
<p>
 "Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "So while there's no point in
asking any of you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if
there were a student or two in my classes who harbored ambitions of
being the next Dark Lord. After all,
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 wanted to be the
next Dark Lord when
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 was a young Slytherin."
</p>
<p>
 This time the laughter was much more widespread.
</p>
<p>
 "Well, it
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 the House of the ambitious, after all,"
Professor Quirrell said, smiling. "I didn't realize until later
that what I really enjoyed was Battle Magic, and that my true
ambition was to become a great fighting wizard and someday teach at
Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen years old, I read
through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library,
scrutinizing the lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a
list of all the mistakes that
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 would never make when
 <em>
  I
 </em>
 was a Dark Lord -"
</p>
<p>
 Harry giggled before he could stop himself.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess
what was the very first item on that list?"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Great.
 </em>
 "Um... never use a complicated way of dealing
with an enemy when you can just Abracadabra them?"
</p>
<p>
 "The
 <em>
  term,
 </em>
 Mr. Potter, is
 <em>
  Avada Kedavra,
 </em>
 "
Professor Quirrell's voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason,
"and no, that was
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 on the list I made at age thirteen.
Would you care to guess again?"
</p>
<p>
 "Ah... never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell laughed. "Ah, now
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 was number
two. My, Mr. Potter, have we been reading the same books?"
</p>
<p>
 There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry
clenched his jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would
accomplish nothing.
</p>
<p>
 "But no. The
 <em>
  first
 </em>
 item was, 'I will not go around
provoking strong, vicious enemies.' The history of the world would
be very different if Mornelithe Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped
that elementary point. Now
 <em>
  if,
 </em>
 Mr. Potter - just
 <em>
  if
 </em>
 by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to the
one I held as a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is not your
ambition to become a
 <em>
  stupid
 </em>
 Dark Lord."
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, gritting his teeth, "I am a
 <em>
  Ravenclaw
 </em>
 and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period.
I know that what I did today was dumb. But it wasn't
 <em>
  Dark!
 </em>
 I was
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 the one who threw the first punch in that
fight!"
</p>
<p>
 "You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age.
Thus I anticipated your answer and altered today's lesson plan
accordingly. Mr. Gregory Goyle, if you would come forward,
please?"
</p>
<p>
 There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn't been
expecting that.
</p>
<p>
 Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather
uncertain and worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached
the dais.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the
desk. He looked suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and
he drew himself up into a clearly recognizable martial arts
stance.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle
had been called up.
</p>
<p>
 "Most wizards," Professor Quirrell said, "do not bother much
with what a Muggle would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger
than a fist? This attitude is stupid. Wands are held in fists. If
you want to be a great fighting wizard you
 <em>
  must
 </em>
 learn
martial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle. I will
now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I
learned in a
 <em>
  dojo,
 </em>
 a Muggle school of martial arts, of
which I shall speak more shortly. For now..." Professor Quirrell
took several steps forward, still in stance, advancing on where Mr.
Goyle stood. "Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack me."
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Quirrell," said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as
the professor's was, "can I ask what level -"
</p>
<p>
 "Sixth
 <em>
  dan
 </em>
 . You will not be hurt and neither will I.
And if you see an opening, please take it."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.
</p>
<p>
 "Note," Professor Quirrell said, "that Mr. Goyle was afraid to
attack someone who did not know martial arts to an acceptable
level, for fear that I, or he, would be hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude
is exactly correct and he has earned three Quirrell points for it.
Now, fight!"
</p>
<p>
 The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor
blocked every blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle
blocked and spun and tried to trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and
Quirrell hopped over it and it was all happening too fast for Harry
to make sense of what was going on and then Goyle was on his back
with his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually
 <em>
  flying through
the air
 </em>
 and then he hit the ground shoulder first and
rolled.
</p>
<p>
 "Stop!" cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a
little panicked. "You win!"
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and
falling from the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward
Professor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using
a peculiar springing motion that made no use of his hands.
</p>
<p>
 There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total
confusion.
</p>
<p>
 "Mr. Goyle," said Professor Quirrell, "what vitally important
technique did I demonstrate?"
</p>
<p>
 "How to fall correctly when someone throws you," said Mr. Goyle.
"It's one of the very first lessons you learn -"
</p>
<p>
 "That too," said Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 There was a pause.
</p>
<p>
 "The vitally important technique which I demonstrated," said
Professor Quirrell, "was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank
you."
</p>
<p>
 Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered.
Harry felt the same way.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning
on it. "Sometimes we forget the most basic things, since it has
been too long since we learned them. I realized I had done the same
with my own lesson plan. You do not teach students to throw until
you have taught them to fall. And I must not teach you to fight if
you do not understand how to lose."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a
hint of pain, a touch of sorrow, in those eyes. "I learned how to
lose in a
 <em>
  dojo
 </em>
 in Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is
where all the good martial artists live. This
 <em>
  dojo
 </em>
 taught
a style which had a reputation among fighting wizards as adapting
well to magical dueling. The Master of that
 <em>
  dojo
 </em>
 - an old
man by Muggle standards - was that style's greatest living teacher.
He had no idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study
there, and was one of the few students accepted that year, from
among many contenders. There might have been a tiny bit of special
influence involved."
</p>
<p>
 There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn't share it.
That hadn't been right at all.
</p>
<p>
 "In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been
beaten in a particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and
attacked my sparring partner -"
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yikes.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 "- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master,
surprisingly, did not expel me on the spot. But he told me that
there was a flaw in my temperament. He explained it to me, and I
knew that he was right. And then he said that I would learn how to
lose."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's face was expressionless.
</p>
<p>
 "Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the
 <em>
  dojo
 </em>
 lined up. One by one, they approached me. I was
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 to defend myself. I was only to beg for mercy. One by
one, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the ground.
Some of them spat on me. They called me awful names in their
language. And to each one, I had to say, 'I lose!' and similar such
things, such as 'I beg you to stop!' and 'I admit you're better
than me!'"
</p>
<p>
 Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was
no way something like that could have happened to the dignified
Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 "I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic
alone I could have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I
learned to lose. To this day I remember it as one of the most
unpleasant hours of my life. And when I left that dojo eight months
later - which was not nearly enough time, but was all I could
afford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why
that had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most
valuable lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. "You are wondering
where this marvelous
 <em>
  dojo
 </em>
 is, and whether you can study
there. You cannot. For not long afterward, another would-be student
came to that hidden place, to that remote mountain.
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."
</p>
<p>
 There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in
simultaneously. Harry felt sick to his stomach. He knew what was
coming.
</p>
<p>
 "The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise,
glowing red eyes and all. The students tried to bar his way and he
simply Apparated through. There was terror there, but discipline,
and the Master came forth. And the Dark Lord demanded - not asked,
but demanded - to be taught."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's face was very hard. "Perhaps the Master had
read too many books telling the lie that a true martial artist
could defeat even demons. For whatever reason, the Master refused.
The Dark Lord asked why he could not be a student. The Master told
him he had no patience, and that was when the Dark Lord ripped his
tongue out."
</p>
<p>
 There was a collective gasp.
</p>
<p>
 "You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush
the Dark Lord and fell over, stunned where they stood. And
then..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's voice faltered for a moment, then
resumed.
</p>
<p>
 "There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which
produces unbearable pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer
than a few minutes it produces permanent insanity. One by one, the
Dark Lord Crucioed the Master's students into insanity, and then
finished them off with the Killing Curse, while the Master was
forced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the
Master followed. I learned this from the single surviving student,
whom the Dark Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had
been a friend of mine..."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment
later, he once again seemed calm and composed.
</p>
<p>
 "Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers," Professor Quirrell
said quietly. "It is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and
anyone who makes a habit of fighting them soon learns to rely on
it. Understand that the Dark Lord did
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 win that day.
His goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a
single lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold.
It did not show his strength, but rather an exploitable
weakness."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's gaze focused on a single child in the
classroom.
</p>
<p>
 "Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.
</p>
<p>
 "What
 <em>
  precisely
 </em>
 did you do wrong today, Mr.
Potter?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my
temper."
</p>
<p>
 "That is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will
describe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what
are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns -
trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight
with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws
sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a
better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe
their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest
with a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely
hurt."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry
from the repeater screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter,
is that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and
accept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance
contest. When a
 <em>
  Hogwarts professor
 </em>
 challenged you, you did
not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed
your claws, heedless of the danger. You
 <em>
  escalated,
 </em>
 and
then you escalated
 <em>
  again.
 </em>
 It started with a slap at you
from Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead
of losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw.
Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you
escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won
at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."
</p>
<p>
 "I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been precise.
 <em>
  Frighteningly
 </em>
 precise. Now that
Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that
it was an
 <em>
  exactly
 </em>
 accurate description of what had
happened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to
wonder whether they were right about other things too, like your
intent to kill.
</p>
<p>
 "The
 <em>
  next
 </em>
 time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate
a contest rather than lose, you may lose
 <em>
  all
 </em>
 the stakes
you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can
guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House
points."
</p>
<p>
 Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.
</p>
<p>
 ''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts,
a much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a
 <em>
  lie.
 </em>
 If you had been -"
</p>
<p>
 "I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best
possible time to make my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But
that would have meant
 <em>
  losing
 </em>
 . Letting him be dominant over
me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted
to learn from."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood
perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to
lose."
</p>
<p>
 "I -"
</p>
<p>
 "I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both
that you need this and that you are strong enough to take it. I
assure you that your experience will not be so harsh as what I went
through, though you may well remember it as the worst fifteen
minutes of your young life."
</p>
<p>
 Harry swallowed. "Professor Quirrell," he said in a small voice,
"can we do this some other time?"
</p>
<p>
 "No," Professor Quirrell said simply. "You are five days into
your Hogwarts education and already this has happened. Today is
Friday. Our
 <em>
  next
 </em>
 defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... No, we do
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 have
time to wait."
</p>
<p>
 There were a few laughs at this, but very few.
</p>
<p>
 "Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter.
What I would like to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any
offensive spells, because I would then hear that you had severely
hurt or even killed someone. Unfortunately I am told that your
fingers are already powerful weapons. Do not snap them at any time
during this lesson."
</p>
<p>
 More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.
</p>
<p>
 Harry felt like he might cry. "Professor Quirrell, if you do
anything like what you talked about, it's going to make me angry,
and I really would rather not get angry again today -"
</p>
<p>
 "The point is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 to avoid getting angry," Professor
Quirrell said, his face looking grave. "Anger is natural. You need
to learn how to lose even when you are angry. Or at least
 <em>
  pretend
 </em>
 to lose so that you can
 <em>
  plan
 </em>
 your
vengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course any of
you think he really
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 better -"
</p>
<p>
 "I'm not!" shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little
frantic. "I know you didn't really lose! Please don't plan any
vengeances!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn't know
about his mysterious dark side. "Professor, we really need to talk
about this after class -"
</p>
<p>
 "We will," Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise.
"After you learn how to lose." His face was serious. "It should go
without saying that I will exclude anything which could injure you
or even cause you significant pain. The pain will come from the
difficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and escalating the
battle until you win."
</p>
<p>
 Harry's breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more
frightened than he'd been after leaving the Potions classroom.
"Professor Quirrell," he managed to say, "I don't want you to get
fired over this -"
</p>
<p>
 "I will not be," Professor Quirrell said, "if
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 tell
them afterward that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do."
For a moment Professor Quirrell's voice turned very dry. "Believe
me, they have tolerated worse in their hallways. This case will be
exceptional only in that it happens within a classroom."
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Quirrell," Harry whispered, but he thought his voice
was still being repeated everywhere, "do you really believe that if
I don't do this, I might hurt someone?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes," Professor Quirrell said simply.
</p>
<p>
 "Then," Harry felt nauseous, "I'll do it."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. "So... with
the full approval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape
cannot be blamed for your actions... do any of you wish to show
your dominance over the Boy-Who-Lived? Shove him around, push him
to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?"
</p>
<p>
 Five hands went up.
</p>
<p>
 "Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What
part of
 <em>
  pretending
 </em>
 to lose did you not understand? If
Harry Potter does become the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down
and kill you after he graduates."
</p>
<p>
 The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.
</p>
<p>
 "I won't," Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. "I
swear never to take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose.
Professor Quirrell... would you
 <em>
  please
 </em>
 ...
 <em>
  stop
 </em>
 that?"
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell sighed. "I
 <em>
  am
 </em>
 sorry, Mr. Potter. I
realize that you must find this equally annoying whether you intend
to become a Dark Lord or not. But those children
 <em>
  also
 </em>
 had
an important life lesson to learn. Would it be acceptable if I
awarded you a Quirrell point in apology?"
</p>
<p>
 "Make it two," Harry said.
</p>
<p>
 There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the
tension.
</p>
<p>
 "Done," Professor Quirrell said.
</p>
<p>
 "And after I graduate I'm going to hunt you down and
 <em>
  tickle
 </em>
 you."
</p>
<p>
 There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn't
smile.
</p>
<p>
 Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force
the conversation through the narrow course that would make people
realize he wasn't a Dark Lord after all...
 <em>
  why
 </em>
 was
Professor Quirrell so suspicious of him?
</p>
<p>
 "Professor," said Draco's unamplified voice. "It is also not my
own ambition to become a stupid Dark Lord."
</p>
<p>
 There was a shocked silence in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  You don't have to do this!
 </em>
 Harry almost blurted out
loud, but checked himself in time; Draco might not wish it known
that he was doing this out of friendship for Harry... or out of the
desire to appear friendly...
</p>
<p>
 Calling
 <em>
  that
 </em>
 a
 <em>
  desire to appear friendly
 </em>
 made
Harry feel small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him,
it was working perfectly.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. "
 <em>
  You
 </em>
 worry that you cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw
which describes Mr. Potter also describes you?
 <em>
  Surely
 </em>
 your
father taught you better."
</p>
<p>
 "When it comes to talking, maybe," said Draco, now on the
repeater screen. "Not when it comes to being shoved around and
pushed to the ground. I want to be fully as strong as you,
Professor Quirrell."
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went up and stayed up. "I am
afraid, Mr. Malfoy," he said after a time, "that the arrangements I
made for Mr. Potter, involving some older Slytherins who will be
told
 <em>
  afterward
 </em>
 how stupid they were, would not carry over
onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are already
very strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter
failed today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and
apologize to you and whomever you have hurt. I do not think this
will be necessary, however."
</p>
<p>
 "I understand, professor," said Draco.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell looked over the class. "Does anyone else wish
to become strong?"
</p>
<p>
 Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from
his back row, looked like they were opening their mouths but not
saying anything. In the end, no one spoke.
</p>
<p>
 "Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year's
armies," said Professor Quirrell, "should he deign to engage in
that after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come
forward."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">></p>
<p>
 <em>
  Yes,
 </em>
 Professor Quirrell had said,
 <em>
  it must be in
front of everyone, in front of your friends, because that is where
Snape confronted you and that is where you must learn to
lose.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence,
and with requests from both Harry and the professor not to
intervene. Hermione had her face turned away, but she hadn't spoken
out or even given him any sort of significant look, maybe because
she'd been there in Potions too.
</p>
<p>
 Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a
Muggle dojo, which Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor
for when Harry was pushed down.
</p>
<p>
 Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell
was right about his intent to kill...
</p>
<p>
 Harry's wand lay on Professor Quirrell's desk, not because Harry
knew any spells that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry
thought) he might have tried to jam it through someone's eye
socket. His pouch lay there, now containing his protected but still
potentially fragile Time-Turner.
</p>
<p>
 Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him
some boxing gloves and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell
had given him a look of silent understanding, and refused.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes,
I will not go for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in
Hogwarts, I'll be arrested,
 </em>
 Harry chanted to himself, trying
to hammer the thought into his brain, hoping it would stay there if
his intent to kill took over.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins
of different years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he'd
hit with a pie. Two others from that confrontation were also
present. The one who'd said to stop, that they really shouldn't do
this, was missing.
</p>
<p>
 "I repeat," Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern,
"Potter is
 <em>
  not
 </em>
 to be really hurt. Any and all
 <em>
  accidents
 </em>
 will be treated as deliberate. Do you
understand?"
</p>
<p>
 The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.
</p>
<p>
 "Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few
pegs," Professor Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the
first-years understood.
</p>
<p>
 By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front
of the group.
</p>
<p>
 "Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick.
He is better than you and he is about to show you that."
</p>
<p>
 Derrick strode forward and Harry's brain screamed discordantly,
he must not run away, he must not fight back -
</p>
<p>
 Derrick stopped an arm's length away from Harry.
</p>
<p>
 Harry wasn't angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he
beheld a teenage boy fully half a meter taller than himself, with
clearly defined muscles, facial hair, and a grin of terrible
anticipation.
</p>
<p>
 "Ask him not to hurt you," Professor Quirrell said. "Perhaps if
he sees that you're pathetic enough, he'll decide that you're
boring, and go away."
</p>
<p>
 There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 "Please," Harry said, his voice faltering, "don't, hurt,
me..."
</p>
<p>
 "That didn't sound very sincere," said Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very
superior and...
</p>
<p>
 ...Harry's blood temperature was dropping...
</p>
<p>
 "Please don't hurt me," Harry tried again.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell shook his head. "How in Merlin's name did you
manage to make that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one
response you can possibly expect from Mr. Derrick."
</p>
<p>
 Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.
</p>
<p>
 Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop
himself, straightened up icily.
</p>
<p>
 "Wrong," said Professor Quirrell, "wrong, wrong, wrong."
</p>
<p>
 "You bumped into me, Potter," Derrick said. "Apologize."
</p>
<p>
 "I'm sorry!"
</p>
<p>
 "You don't
 <em>
  sound
 </em>
 sorry," said Derrick.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's eyes widened in indignation, he
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 managed to
make that sound pleading -
</p>
<p>
 Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands
and knees.
</p>
<p>
 The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry's vision, not far
away.
</p>
<p>
 He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives in
teaching this so-called
 <em>
  lesson.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 A foot rested on Harry's buttocks and a moment later Harry was
pushed hard to the side, sending him sprawling on his back.
</p>
<p>
 Derrick laughed. "This is
 <em>
  fun,
 </em>
 " he said.
</p>
<p>
 All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing
to the Headmaster's office. That would be the end of this
 <em>
  Defense Professor
 </em>
 and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts
and... Professor McGonagall would be angry about that, but...
</p>
<p>
 (An image of Professor McGonagall's face flashed before his
eyes, she didn't look angry, just sad -)
</p>
<p>
 "Now tell him that he's better than you, Potter," said Professor
Quirrell's voice.
</p>
<p>
 "You're, better, than, me."
</p>
<p>
 Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his
chest and shoved him back down to the mat.
</p>
<p>
 The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action
and their consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity.
The fool wouldn't be expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in
the groin would stun him long enough for -
</p>
<p>
 "Try again," said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp
motion Harry rolled and sprang to his feet and whirled on where
stood his real enemy, the Defense Professor -
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell said, "You have no patience."
</p>
<p>
 Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a
picture of a wizened old man with blood pouring from his mouth
after Harry had ripped his tongue out -
</p>
<p>
 A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then
sat down on him, sending Harry's breath whooshing out.
</p>
<p>
 "Stop!" Harry screamed. "Please stop!"
</p>
<p>
 "Better," said Professor Quirrell. "That even sounded
sincere."
</p>
<p>
 It
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening
thing, it
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly,
fear and cold anger both flushing through him -
</p>
<p>
 "Lose," said Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 "I, lose," Harry forced out.
</p>
<p>
 "I like it," Derrick said from on top of him. "Lose some
more."
</p>
<p class="sequence-break">%</p>
<p>
 Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of
older Slytherins to another set of hands that shoved him again.
Harry had long since passed the point of trying not to cry, and was
now just trying not to fall down.
</p>
<p>
 "What are you, Potter?" said Derrick.
</p>
<p>
 "A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you're b-better, than
me, please stop -"
</p>
<p>
 Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands
not quite able to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then
began struggling to his feet again -
</p>
<p>
 "
 <em>
  Enough!
 </em>
 " said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding
sharp enough to cut iron. "Step away from Mr. Potter!"
</p>
<p>
 Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his
blood, which had been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
 Then Harry collapsed to the mat.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older
Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 "And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to
explain to you as well," finished Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp
as professor Quirrell's, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had
used to imitate his father, and it was saying things like
 <em>
  could
have put Slytherin House in jeopardy
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  who knows how
many allies in this school alone
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  total lack of
awareness, never mind cunning
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  dull thugs, useful for
nothing but lackeys
 </em>
 and something in Harry's hindbrain,
despite everything he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.
</p>
<p>
 Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold,
his mind utterly exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes's song, but
without the phoenix present he couldn't remember the melody and
when he tried to imagine it he couldn't seem to think of anything
except a bird chirping.
</p>
<p>
 Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older
Slytherins they were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and
struggled to sit up, "Wait," Harry said, forcing the words out,
"there's something, I want, to say, to them -"
</p>
<p>
 "Wait on Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said coldly to the
departing Slytherins.
</p>
<p>
 Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the
direction of his classmates. He didn't want to see how they were
looking at him now. He didn't want to see their pity.
</p>
<p>
 So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still
seemed to be in a state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread
was on their faces.
</p>
<p>
 His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the
imagination of this moment, and went on pretending to lose.
</p>
<p>
 Harry said, "No one will -"
</p>
<p>
 "Stop," said Professor Quirrell. "If that's what I think it is,
please wait until after they're gone. They'll hear about it later.
We all have our lessons to learn, Mr. Potter."
</p>
<p>
 "All right," Harry said.
</p>
<p>
 "You. Go."
</p>
<p>
 The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.
</p>
<p>
 "No one's to take any revenge on them," Harry said hoarsely.
"That's a request to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I
had my lesson to learn, they helped me learn it, they had their
lesson to learn too, it's over. If you tell this story, make sure
you tell that part too."
</p>
<p>
 Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.
</p>
<p>
 "You lost," said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the
first time. It sounded strange coming from the professor, like his
voice shouldn't even be able to do that.
</p>
<p>
 Harry
 <em>
  had
 </em>
 lost. There had been moments when the cold
anger had faded entirely, replaced by fear, and during those
moments he'd begged the older Slytherins and he'd meant it...
</p>
<p>
 "And are you yet alive?" said Professor Quirrell, still with
that strange gentleness.
</p>
<p>
 Harry managed to nod.
</p>
<p>
 "Not all losing is like this," said Professor Quirrell. "There
are compromises and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to
placate bullies. There is a whole art form to manipulating others
by letting them be dominant over you. But first, losing must be
 <em>
  thinkable
 </em>
 . Will you remember how you lost?"
</p>
<p>
 "Yes."
</p>
<p>
 "Will you be able to lose?"
</p>
<p>
 "I... think so..."
</p>
<p>
 "I think so too." Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin
hair almost touched the floor. "Congratulations, Harry Potter, you
win."
</p>
<p>
 There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started
all at once like a massive thunderclap.
</p>
<p>
 Harry's couldn't keep the shock from his face. He risked a
glance at his classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity
but awe. The applause was coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and
Hufflepuff and even Slytherin, probably because Draco Malfoy was
applauding too. Some students were standing up from their chairs
and half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.
</p>
<p>
 So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over
him, feeling stronger, and maybe even a little healed.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took
quite a while.
</p>
<p>
 "Surprised, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said. His voice
sounded amused. "You have just found out that the real world does
not
 <em>
  always
 </em>
 work like your worst nightmares. Yes, if you
had been some poor anonymous boy being abused, then they would
probably have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as they
comforted you from their loftier perches. That
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 human
nature, I'm afraid. But
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 they already know for a figure
of power. And they saw you confront your fear and keep confronting
it, even though you could have walked away at any time. Did you
think less of
 <em>
  me
 </em>
 when I told you that I had deliberately
endured being spat upon?"
</p>
<p>
 Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically
clamped down. He didn't trust this miraculous respect enough to
start crying again in front of it.
</p>
<p>
 "Your
 <em>
  extraordinary
 </em>
 achievement in my class deserves an
extraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my
compliments on behalf of my House, and remember from this day
forward that not all Slytherins are alike. There are Slytherins,
and then there are Slytherins." Professor Quirrell was smiling
quite broadly as he said this. "Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw."
</p>
<p>
 There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among
the Ravenclaw students, howling and whistling and cheering.
</p>
<p>
 (And in the same moment Harry felt something
 <em>
  wrong
 </em>
 about that, Professor McGonagall had been right, there
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 have been consequences, there should have been a
cost and a price to be paid, you couldn't just put everything back
the way it was like that -)
</p>
<p>
 But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn't
possibly say no.
</p>
<p>
 His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry
could not even believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let
alone producing good suggestions.
</p>
<p>
 "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, as clearly as he could through
his burning throat. "You are everything a member of your House
should be, and I think you must be just what Salazar Slytherin had
in mind when he helped found Hogwarts. I thank you and your House,"
Draco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning his finger,
 <em>
  keep going
 </em>
 , "and I think this calls for three cheers for
Slytherin. With me, everyone?" Harry paused. "
 <em>
  Huzzah!
 </em>
 "
Only a few people managed to join in on the first try.
"
 <em>
  Huzzah!
 </em>
 " This time most of Ravenclaw was in on it.
"
 <em>
  Huzzah!
 </em>
 " That was almost all of Ravenclaw, a scattering
of Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.
</p>
<p>
 Draco's hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.
</p>
<p>
 Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few
were staring at Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was
looking at Harry with a calculating, intrigued expression.
</p>
<p>
 Professor Quirrell bowed. "Thank
 <em>
  you
 </em>
 , Harry Potter," he
said, still with that broad smile. He turned to the class. "Now,
believe it or not, we still have half an hour left in this session,
and that is enough to introduce the Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of
course, is going off and taking a well-earned rest."
</p>
<p>
 "I can -"
</p>
<p>
 "Idiot," Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already
laughing. "Your classmates can teach you afterward, or I'll tutor
you privately if that's what it takes. But
 <em>
  right now
 </em>
 ,
you're going through the third door from the left in the back of
the stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of
exceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from
the Hogwarts library. You may not take anything else with you,
particularly not your textbooks. Now go."
</p>
<p>
 Harry went.
